         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe indeed I thus rendred</hi> [decently and according to order or appointment] <hi>and affirmed the importance of that place to be, that all be done in the Church according to Cuſtome and appointment, rendring this reaſon of the former, becauſe it was implyed in</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to order or appointment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To the former of theſe he makes his firſt exception, thus, [he dares not affirme that this is the immediate ſenſe of the place, but onely that it is implyed; it cannot be denyed, but that decency doth imply ſuch customes, the omiſſion of which doth neceſſarily infer indecency; but that the omiſſion of ſuch Ceremonies as ours, doth infer indecency, the Doctor and all his party can never make good: What undecencie can the Doctor prove to be in the administration of Baptiſm without the Croſſe; as alſo in publique Prayers and Preaching without a Surplice? But of this ſee farther in</hi> Ames <hi>in the places but now quoted: The Doctor may perhaps look upon him as an inconſiderable adverſary. But we ſhall think his Arguments conſiderable; untill the Doctor, or ſome other of his party give a ſatisfactory anſwer unto them. In the mean while let us examine the proof that the Doctor brings for this ſenſe: and it is becauſe cuſtome is the onely rule of decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Propoſition, though very strange, is proofleſſe; and therefore we might as well reject it, as the Doctor dictates it. But I ſhall adde a confutation of it, from theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If cuſtome be the only rule of decency, then nothing elſe can be a rule thereof
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137084:3"/>beſides cuſtomes, but this is falſe; for the light and law of Nature, is alſo a rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing can be undecent, that is agreeable unto the onely rule of decency but divers things are undecent, which yet can plead custome; and this is ſo evident, as that I will not ſo much undervalue the Doctors judgement, as to endeavour any proofs thereof. It is impoſſible that the onely rule of decency ſhould be undecent; but yet it is very poſſible that many cuſtomes ſhould be undecent, and therefore I ſhall conclude, that cuſtome is not the only rule of decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Laſtly, unto cuſtome, as you may ſee in both</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>and</hi> Aquinas, <hi>the frequent uſage of a thing is required. But now there may be decency or handſomneſſe in the firſt uſage of a thing; and of this decency cuſtome is not the rule, and therefore it is not the only rule of decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The first thing here charged on me, is timidity, that I dare not ſay what I ſaid not, and this attended with a conceſſion (in a limited ſenſe) of the truth of what I did ſay; the ſecond is the impertinence or unſufficiency of that, in that limited ſenſe, to prove what he conceives I would have from it,</hi> viz. <hi>that the omiſſion of our ceremonies doth inferre indecency: And the proof of this charge twofold,</hi> 1. <hi>by way of queſtion, founded in two inſtances, the Croſſe in Baptiſm, and the Surplice in publique Prayer, and Preaching:</hi> 2. <hi>By reference to</hi> Ames, <hi>and reſolving to think his arguments conſiderable, till a ſatisfactory anſwer be given them. And his third charge, is my uſing an unſufficient proof to prove my interpretation,</hi> viz. <hi>this, [becauſe cuſtome is the onely rule of decency] which he confutes by three arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe three charges I ſhall now very breifly examine, and, if I miſtake not, clearly evacuate. The firſt by aſsuring him,</hi> 1. <hi>that I did dare to ſay, and indeed ſaid (as I then thought perspicuouſly) the full of what I meant; but that it was no way incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me, to ſay either what I did not mean, or what Mr.</hi> J. <hi>or any other ſhould be juſtly able to charge of want of truth in the leaſt degree. And</hi> 2. <hi>if what I ſaid cannot, as he confeſſes, be denied, to have truth in it in one ſenſe, I demand why muſt it be a not daring (which is wont to ſignifie timidity or cowardiſe) that I affirmed it not in another ſenſe, wherein he doth not conſent to it.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="jeanes" type="part">
               <head>Jeanes.</head>
               <p>The not daring of a thing proceeds from, not only <hi>timidity,</hi> but alſo from <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>ſhame:</hi> When we ſay of men in controverſal writings, that they dare not affirm ſuch and ſuch errours, we do not reproach them with cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, unleſſe he be a coward that is afraid, or aſhamed to deliver an untruth. That <hi>according unto cuſtome</hi> is the immediate ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is a very groſs &amp; evident falſhood; &amp; when I ſaid that you dared not to affirm it, my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly was, that your conſcience or ſhame kept you from ſuch an affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what wrong I have herein done you I am yet to ſeek.</p>
               <p>If you demand why I ſay that, you dare not ſay what you ſaid not?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I have <hi>two reaſons</hi> for it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In entrance into this diſpute, I did, as is uſual in Controverſies, premiſe what I took for uncontroverted on both ſides. 1. for your part, I thought you would not deny, but that the immediate ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was not <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto cuſtome;</hi> and then, I propounded for my owne part what I granted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though in Charity I judge, that you dare not ſay, that <hi>according unto cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:137084:3"/>is the immediate ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet I muſt needs tell you, that by your opinion it is incumbent upon you to ſay as much, and that I <hi>thus prove:</hi> You ſay that <hi>according to cuſtome</hi> is the importance of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate and full importance of it,</hi> for that you ſhould ſo trifle, as to ſay, that you meant, it is onely the <hi>partiall,</hi> and <hi>inadequate importance</hi> of it, I will not ſo much as imagine: But now, if it be not the <hi>expreſſe,</hi> and <hi>immediate ſenſe</hi> of the word, but onely <hi>implyed</hi> therein, as <hi>drawn there-from, as a ſequele or inference; by way of deduction or conſequence,</hi> it may onely be a part or peice of the importance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: to prove then, that 'tis the full and adequate importance of the word, you muſt make good, that it is the immediate ſenſe of it.</p>

                  <hi>All people, I think, in the world, have ſome outward ſignifications, and expreſſions of Reverence; but all have not the ſame, but according to Topical cuſtomes, ſome different, ſome contrary to others: We of this and all our neighbour nations expreſse reverence by uncovering the head, the Turks doe the contrary. Again, among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 'tis cuſtomary for men ſo to expreſſe their reverence, but for women, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, it is not, but the contrary; and ſo it is ſtill among us. Nay it was once among ſome Heathens</hi> (<hi>that worſhipt</hi> Mercury) <hi>an act of the higheſt reverence, even of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to throw ſtones at their God; among others, to cut themſelves with Lances, when they were a praying to him. And it can be no news to Mr.</hi> J. <hi>that theſe customes were not obſerved by other Countries; the Jews that threw ſtones at Christ, and the</hi> Daemoniack <hi>that cut himſelf with them, were neither of them interpretable to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Unleſſe you can prove, that there cannot be outward ſignifications and expreſſions of reverence in Gods ſervice, without humane Symbolical ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, all this your enlargement about the expreſſions of reverence will be to no purpoſe. We require reverence in all parts of Gods worſhip as well as you; but then we hold, that Gods worſhip may be performed reverently, and in a ſeemly manner, without myſtical ceremonies of humane invention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Kneeling in Prayer is an expreſſion of the higheſt degree of Reverence, Adoration; and it hath a higher rule than Cuſtome, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture and the light of Nature: No Cuſtome can render this Kneeling undecent; unleſſe you will ſay thoſe words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6, doe not oblige Chriſtians: <hi>O come,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137084:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>let us worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our maker.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>. Thus for expreſſion of reverence, 'tis a cuſtome with Papiſts not to touch the bread with their hands, but to have it put into their mouths; and upon the like pretence of reverence, it is cuſtomary amongſt them, for Lay-men to abſtain from the Cup altogether.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, why you bring in the Heathens throwing of ſtones at <hi>Mercury</hi> in a way of worſhip, I cannot divine; for I cannot imagine, that you think it to be a decent way of worſhip, and if it be undecent, then it ſerveth nothing unto the exemplification of your meaning.</p>

                  <hi>This therefore was no dark, but viſible foundation of what I ſaid; In aſſigning any rite or ceremony for the ſervice of God,</hi> decency, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle, was to be obſerved, the onely rule to judge of that, is, ſay I, to conſider the Cuſtomes of that particular place, of which we conſult. Where bewing the knee, or kneeling on the ground is cuſtomarily uſed as a token of reverence, where putting off, or keeping off the hat, there the choice of Ceremonies muſt be made with respect to thoſe particular customes: Here 'tis evident, that I mean not the frequent uſage of that ceremony, in oppoſition to a firſt uſage of it, as Mr.</hi> J. <hi>is willing to miſtake me, and found one of his arguments upon that miſtake, but the ſtanding-cuſtome of the place, by which, as by an argument or evidence, ſuch a ceremony is demonstrated to be a reverential reſpect, and ſo (for the ſervice of God, to whom all reverence is due) decent in that place, though in nature or in the estimation of all other men, it be not ſo.</hi>

                  </gap> the frequent uſage of that ceremony in oppoſition to the firſt uſage of it: This evidence of your meaning you have not ſo much as attempted to prove; and if you ſhall for the future make ſuch an attempt, it would, I am afraid, prove ſucceſleſs. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of a thing (unleſſe you can faſten upon it a ſenſe or meaning never yet heard of) is oppoſed unto the firſt uſage of that thing; for cuſtome implyeth the frequent uſage of a thing, and to ſay that the frequent uſage of a thing is the firſt uſage of it, is an evident repugnancy and an apparent contradiction, <hi>contradictio in adjecto oppoſitum in oppoſito,</hi> as they ſay. I am therefore much to ſeek for the ſenſe and reaſon of that <hi>Antitheſis</hi> you make in theſe words, I mean, not the frequent uſage of that ceremony in oppoſition to a firſt uſage of it, but the ſtanding cuſtome of the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for 'tis impoſſible that the ſtanding cuſtome

In that which followeth, there is nothing of argument, unleſſe you can prove every ceremony, which can plead the ſtanding cuſtome of a place, to be a fitting and decent expreſſion of that reverential reſpect, which is due unto God. Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> in his Book of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament of the bleſſed Body and Blood of Chriſt, p. 80, 81. ſheweth that the opinion of reverence, hath been the damme and nurſe of manyfold ſuperſtitions; and after ſuch demonſtration he quotes a ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon Joh. 13.8. <hi>Let us therefore learne to honour and reverence Christ as he would, and not as we think fit.</hi>

Now if in the former of theſe, the</hi> mode <hi>he ſpeaks of, as agreeable to the dignity of thoſe things which are inſtituted, be it ſelf-ſuppoſed by him to be inſtituted by men, then muſt he acknowledge humane power of inſtituting ceremonies, which being ſo contrary to his deſign, I muſt reſolve not to be intended by him; but rather, that as the ſacred things are inſtituted by God, ſo the</hi> mode <hi>which is conſentaneous to their dignity is inſtituted by God alſo, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is decent in</hi> ſacris, <hi>which is not ſo inſtituted. And ſo likewiſe on the ſecond head, that of civill offices.

For by this means many ridiculous things ſhould have been provided for by a ſpecial Law; as for example, that in the Church aſſembly one ſhould not place himſelf in anothers boſome, ſpit in anothers face, or ſhould not make mouthes in holy actions: Yet they are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as commanded from God: 1.

               <p>You are by this time, I hope, conſcious of the great injury you have done unto poor Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> in affixing unto him ſo irrational an opinion, and hereupon I ſhall be bold to give you this advertiſement, that however you may deſpiſe him as a mean Author, unworthy of your peruſal, yet, if you undertake to cenſure and refute him, you muſt read him, or elſe you will be very lyable unto the breach of the ninth Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſſe againſt thy neighbbour.</hi>

               <p>The 1. becauſe the <hi>mode</hi> or manner agreeable unto the dignity of ſacred things is inſtituted by God, as the ſacred things are inſtituted by God: But this propoſition, if it be <hi>particular,</hi> proves nothing, and if it be <hi>univerſal,</hi> is falſe, as you might have ſeen in the next reaſon of <hi>Ames,</hi> but that you cannot ſee wood for trees, as the Proverb is; There is <hi>a mode or manner in the uſe of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things agreeable unto their dignitie, that is not adequate, proper, and peculiar to them, but common unto civill matters of a grave nature together with them;</hi> and this is a matter inculcated by Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in many places,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:137084:8"/>which if you had weighed, you would never have troubled the Reader with this objection, Medul.

                  <q>Although theſe circumſtances of time, place, and other lïke, are wont by ſome to be called rites, or religious Eccleſiaſtical ceremonies, yet in their nature they have nothing that is proper to Religion, and therefore religious worſhip doth not properly conſiſt in them, however by neglect and contempt of ſuch circumſtances, the ſanctity of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip is in ſome ſort violated, becauſe the common reſpect of order and decency, which do equally agree to religious and civil actions cannot bee ſevered from religious worſhip, without diminiſhing of the ſanctity and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</q>

               <p>Thus alſo largely in his Manuduction to the diſpute about humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, pag. 55, 56. <q>If men and women come purpoſely in their beſt apparel to Church, if they compoſe themſelves to a grave poſture, give the upper place to the chiefeſt perſons, and take ſuch to themſelves as they may hear the Preacher in, and yet have no exception taken againſt them for it, if all the places and ſeats be made cleanly, and fit for a meeting, to be held in a comely faſhion, all theſe are Ceremonies according to the Rejoinder his definition, yet no man but out of contention will affirm, they are meerly religious or eccleſiaſticall: For all theſe in the ſame manner, and to the ſame immediate end, the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would doe, if the meeting were to hear the Magiſtrate propound unto them a grave civil buſineſſe, concerning the Commonwealth affairs. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which remaining the ſame may be civil, is not meerly and properly ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, but common to both uſes, and rather meerly civil, than meerly ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; becauſe civility is ſuppoſed and included in eccleſiaſtical affairs, but eccleſiaſtical proceedings are not ſuppoſed and included in civil. Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> in his original of unbelief, pag. 337. doth well obſerve, that decent behaviour doth change the ſubject onely, not alter its own nature and form, whilſt it is uſed in matters ſacred: nor is the habit of civil complement, or good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſuch an unhallowed weed, as muſt be layd aſide when wee come into the Sanctuary. And indeed there is no more reaſon to ſhut civility out of the Church or ſacred buſineſſe, than to ſhut Religion out of the Town-houſe, or civil affairs.</q>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Medii</hi> is required as a means unto the acceptable celebration of Gods worſhip, but then it is not a <hi>means proper and peculiar thereunto,</hi> for it hath the ſame immediate end both in civil and religious matters, and therefore is <hi>common unto both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate praecepti</hi> you cannot queſtion, unleſſe you will deny the title and obligation unto the Apoſtles injunction, for that it binds as an <hi>edict of nature</hi> we have the teſtimony of your own <hi>Hooker:</hi> if this twofold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of decency be chargeable with any abſurdities, you are as deeply concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to anſwer them as my ſelf: indeed that decency, from the omiſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we cannot inferre indecency is neceſſary, neither <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> nor <hi>medii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with ſuch a decency we have nothing to doe; for it comes not within the compaſſe of the Apoſtolical command, and ſuch is the decency of your ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies altogether unneceſſary; neither commanded by any Law of God, nor neceſſary as a means for the better ſervice of God. But perhaps you may attempt to prove, that God is better ſerved with your Ceremonies, than without them; when I ſhall have ſuch proof from you, I ſhall return it an anſwer.</p>
               <p>In the mean while let us conſider the abſurdity with which you charge the aſſertion of the, but now mentioned, double neceſsity of decency in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>If that be neceſſary,</hi> neceſsitate praecepti, <hi>or</hi> medii, <hi>then undecency,</hi> ſay you,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137084:9"/>
                  <hi>which is oppoſed thereunto, is more than the omiſſion of an indifferent cuſtome, which may, or may not be continued without any offence againſt nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer, the <hi>undecency</hi> here prohibeted by the Apoſtle, is either <hi>by the light of nature,</hi> or <hi>by civil cuſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former is more than the omiſsion of an indifferent cuſtome, and is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate tranſgreſsion againſt nature.</p>
               <p>As for the latter, we muſt diſtinguiſh of a <hi>twofold conſideration of ſuch cuſtomes,</hi> they may be conſidered either <hi>actu ſignato</hi> in the generall, as abſtracted from all ſingularizing circumſtances, or <hi>actu exercito hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as clothed with ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, and ſo they are not indifferent but neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate</hi> both <hi>praecepti</hi> and <hi>medii.</hi> I might exemplifie this by inſtancing in the long hair, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per apparel, <hi>viz.</hi> long garments of women, and the like. There is a paſſage in <hi>Ames,</hi> already quoted, that will be here very appoſite; Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> had demanded of him whether the womens vailes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. were not a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and his anſwer is, <hi>it is indifferent in the generall nature of it, yet at that time, and in that place, they ſinned that did otherwiſe, even before Paul, or any of their Overſeers gave them charge about it.</hi>

                  <hi>Natural decency</hi> is a branch, nay the principal branch of that decency comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtle, and therefore I could not think it excluded by you; but withal, I muſt conclude your interpretation of the Apoſtle, to be very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and defective, when you ſaid the clear importance of the Apoſtles words was, <hi>Let all things be done according to cuſtome;</hi> I was ſo fooliſh to ſuppoſe that you meant this clear importance of the Apoſtles words, was alſo the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of them, neither can you aſſign any reaſon, why I ſhould think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:137084:9"/>according unto the nature of the things ſpoken of: the <hi>omiſſion of natural decency</hi> infers undecency <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> in regard of <hi>an abſolute neceſſity;</hi> the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of civil undecency, infers undecency neceſſarily onely <hi>ex Hypotheſi:</hi> and that inference of indecency which is only neceſſary <hi>ex Hypotheſi,</hi> is more than an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereof, which is fallacious, or at the moſt but probable; and if we ſpeak of this neceſſity, it is very falſe which you ſay, that that omiſſion which thus neceſſarily inferres undecency, inferres it in all that ever did, or ſhall omit it.</p>

                  <hi>Nay, 'tis already past queſtion, that Mr.</hi> J. <hi>in his firſt argument againſt my dictate (as he calls it) ſaith, that the light and law of nature is alſo a rule of decency, and ſo not onely cuſtome: And if ſo, then cuſtome is a rule of decency alſo, and not only the law and light of nature, and where custome, and not the light of nature is the rule, there the omiſſion of that doth not neceſſarily inferre indecency. And of ſuch decency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it is evident that I spake, on the head of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity (and could not speak ſenſe, if I ſpake, either of any other, or of the generall notion of decency, which is competible to any other) and from thence it follows demonſtratively that of that decency of which I spake (though not of that, of which it is certain I spake not) ſtill cuſtome is the onely rule of decency.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>This therefore I hope may ſerve in anſwer to his firſt charge, that of my timidity, that I dared not ſay what I ſaid not; together with a view of his conceſſion of the truth of what I did ſay, and the wary limitation of that conceſſion.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I called your aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> Cuſtome is the onely rule of decencie, a <hi>dictate,</hi> and ſhall call it ſo ſtill, untill you can prove it, and when you bring any ſolid proof of it, abſtracted from your ſubterfuges, for limitations I cannot call them, I ſhall be contented to be your vaſſal.</p>
               <p n="2">2 You ſeem to intimate, that in the things you ſpeak of, cuſtome, and not the light of nature is the rule, but this is very falſe; for cuſtome is <hi>menſura paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiva,</hi> as well as <hi>activa:</hi> When it is a rule of decency, it is firſt meaſured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated

               <p n="3">3. If you ſpeak of ſuch decency alone, the omiſſion whereof doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferre undecency, in reſpect either of an <hi>abſolute,</hi> or <hi>hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yea, but you ſay, that you could not ſpeak ſenſe, if you ſpake either of any other, or of the generall notion of decency which is competible to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe I grant this, what then? this argument is of little prevalency with me, who am in this particular your <hi>Antagoniſt;</hi> for though I acknowledge and admire your great parts and learning, yet I think it not onely poſſible, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable for you, or any other, though never ſo great a ſcholar, to ſpeake nonſence in oppoſition of the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humane ceremonies</hi> have two acceptions. 1. They are taken <hi>largely</hi> for all <hi>circumſtances</hi> of order, decency; as alſo for all meere <hi>indicant</hi> ſigns of reverence, and theſe for diſtinction ſake may be called <hi>circumſtantial ceremonies:</hi> but theſe are not the ceremonies in queſtion; for the Non-conformiſts acknowledge theſe law full, and ſo alſo Uniformity in them; but yet of theſe ceremonies, cuſtome is neither the onely or principal rule, as ſhall be manifeſted when I come unto the examination of your Anſwer unto my Objections againſt this your dictate.</p>
               <p>In a ſecond place, humane ceremonies are taken <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> onely for ſuch as are <hi>doctrinal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſymbolical, and ſacramental,</hi> and unto ſuch neither <hi>decency nor reverence obligeth us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not, firſt, the Apoſtles decency; becauſe in the omiſſion of them there is no undecency.</p>
               <p>Not, ſecondly, that reverence which is due unto God in his worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the omiſſion of them there is no irreverence committed; you may think my notion of reverence to be too narrow; but 'tis the utmoſt <hi>I</hi> can grant you; and indeed 'tis all that Scripture and Reaſon call for: <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> are <hi>privatively</hi> oppoſed, and between <hi>privative oppoſites,</hi> in a capable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, there is no <hi>medium,</hi> either of <hi>abnegation</hi> or <hi>participation,</hi> and therefore when there is no irreverence in the external worſhip of God, that worſhip is reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently adminiſtred: now that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is unreverently adminiſtred when the Croſſe is omitted, or that publique Prayers and Preaching are unreverent, when the Surplice is left off, may perhaps be very affectionately averred by you and others, but I do not hope to live ſo long as to receive from you, or any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for it, ſo much as the ſhadow of an argument.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place then you ſee that <hi>reverence</hi> bindeth not to <hi>humane, religious, myſtical ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, in a ſecond place, it bindeth to lay them quite aſide, becauſe Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are treated very irreverently, when mens inventions are joyned with them, when men ſet their <hi>threſholds by Gods threſholds, and their poſts by his posts,</hi> Ezek. 43.8. that is, when humane inventions are added unto Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
               <p>Yea, but you may perhaps ſay our Ceremonies are joyned with Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances onely as <hi>adjuncts, or annexaries, not as parts of Gods worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But unto this I reply in the words of <hi>Ames</hi> unto <hi>Morton,</hi> all <hi>external ceremonies, whoſe proper uſe is the honouring of God, are external worſhip, as all divinity ſheweth.</hi> Reply unto gen. Def. pag 19.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:137084:12"/>hath been cuſtomary over the world, that in a militia there ſhould be ſome Banner, or Enſign, to which every one ſhould reſort, and fight under it.

               <p n="1">1. As our Chriſtian courſe is a ſpiritual warfare, ſo unto this the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus are a more ſuitable <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Enſign,</hi> than any hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ane invention whatſoever: But you think that the Banner requiſite in our ſpiritual warfare muſt be of humane invention, not divine inſtitution; for otherwiſe you ſpeak nothing to the purpoſe; and if the omiſſion of ſuch a Banner or Enſign be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, you may arraign Chriſt and his Apoſtles as guilty of undency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſigne of the Croſſe hath been a long time uſed by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> or <hi>Banner,</hi> and is it undecent to lay aſide the <hi>Enſign</hi> or <hi>Banner</hi> of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How little weight there is in the cuſtomary uſe of a <hi>Banner</hi> for the decency of the ſign of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> will be apparent by theſe following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a cuſtome in Armies for different companies or troupes to have <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> or <hi>Enſigns;</hi> but it was never the cuſtome of any Armies for every ſeverall ſouldier to carry a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Enſign:</hi> from the cuſtome of a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Enſign</hi> then, how you can conclude for the ſigning of every ſingular Chriſtian with the ſign of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> paſſeth my in agination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The cuſtomary uſe of a Banner is in the whole war, and not onely at the firſt enrolement of Souldiers, and therefore if it prove any thing for the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> it will conclude for the frequent and conſtant uſe of it all the time of our warfare; and this I hope you will not plead for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>permanent Croſſe</hi> hath more proportion unto the <hi>Banners</hi> and <hi>Enſigns</hi> of Armies than the <hi>tranſient</hi> and <hi>aërial Croſſe;</hi> and yet there be ſome of your party, who allow of the tranſient Croſſe in Baptiſme, that diſlike permanent Croſſes in Gods worſhip; becauſe they think there is more danger of ſuperſtition in them: Now theſe men, in all probability, lay no great ſtreſſe upon this your reſemblance of the ſign of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> to a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Enſign,</hi> and my reaſon for this my conjecture (for I u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge it onely as a conjecture) is, becauſe they reject all <hi>permanent Croſſes</hi> in <hi>Gods ſervice,</hi> which doe more reſemble a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Enſign</hi> than a <hi>tranſient Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I have done my beſt to ſound the depth and ſtrength of your argument, and if I be not deceived, thus it ſtands: The omiſſion of a Banner or Enſign, in our ſpiritual warfare, that was uſed by the Primitive Chriſtians, is undecent; but the ſign of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was thus uſed by the Primitive Chriſſtians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omiſſion of it is undecent.</p>
               <p>By Primitive Chriſtians, I ſuppoſe you doe not mean the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or ſuch <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical perſons</hi> as were guided by an infallible ſpirit, and then I deny your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and for this my denial I ſhall give you two reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Chriſt our <hi>great Generall, the Captain of our ſalvation, were hidden all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> and therefore he knew better what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in his worſhip, than all Primitive Chriſtians, han all the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that ever were in the world; and therefore ſeeing there is ſuch a deep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:137084:12"/>of the Croſſe in his word, I ſhall never think it ſo highly decent as you pretend, ſo decent, that the omiſſion of it is undecent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is, and alwaies hath been cuſtomary over the world, at leaſt in civil and wel-governed Nations, that in a Militia all ſhould be done by Commiſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the General. <hi>Manlius</hi> put his own Son to death for fighting with an enemy, though he had the Conqueſt, becauſe it was without order, and <hi>L. Papyrius Curſor</hi> had, for the ſame reaſon, executed <hi>Q. Fabius Rutilianus,</hi> though he had gained a great Victory over the <hi>Samnites,</hi> but that the general interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> pacified him. But now our Prelatiſts can produce no Commiſſion from our <hi>great General,</hi> to uſe any <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Enſign in his worſhip,</hi> but ſuch as he hath already inſtituted, his Word, Sacraments, Diſcipline, and therefore I ſhall condemn the uſage of any ſuch Banner or Enſign, as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion againſt his Military diſcipline.

               </p>
               <p>By this you may ſee that your allegations out of the Fathers are in vaine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you had added a proof of their infallibility, or that they are to be a rule of our faith in matters of this nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One Papiſt is found (ſaith <hi>Parker,</hi> part. 1. pag. 77.) who ſaith,<q> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meant not of the outward ſign, but of the thing ſignified, which is Chriſts death:</q> It is well, that we have this confeſſion from him, that the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:137084:14"/>Fathers cannot be juſtified, in caſe they mean the outward ſign, which they mean undoubtedly, or elſe our oppoſites doe us great wrong, who object the Fathers againſt us in the Outward ceremony of the Croſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that are but tolerably verſed in the Fathers, cannot but confeſſe, that they aſcribe very ſtrange things unto the ſign of the Croſſe; as that it is a neceſſary requiſite of Baptiſme, that it was an Amulet againſt the Devil, and an inſtrument of Miracles, a fence or fortification of the ſoul againſt all ſpirituall adverſaries; but theſe Hyperbolies, however you may excuſe them, yet they are ſo groſſe, as that they are utterly uncapable of any juſt Apology to be made for them; and this without more adoe might ſuffice for anſwer unto ſect. 25, 26, 27, 28. But I ſhall farther give you ſome general exceptions againſt thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Fathers you alledge, and next, ſay ſomething unto them taken ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and apart.</p>
               <p>My general exceptions ſhall be ſix.</p>
               <p>The firſt, the not uſing of the Croſſe by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is a greater prejudice againſt it, than all the countenance can be given unto it by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of after ages; alaſſe! what are <hi>Auguſtine, Athanaſius, Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c. whom you quote, in compariſon of our bleſſed Saviour: unto them <hi>the Spirit was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but in meaſure,</hi> unto him <hi>without meaſure, Joh.</hi> 3.34. And, <hi>it was a ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding, a ſpirit of counſel and knowledge,</hi> Iſa. 11.12. and ſo was able to make ample and ſufficient proviſion for any religious Ceremonies in his Church that he thought requiſite: Why ſhould not we content our ſelves with thoſe few that he hath ordained? eſpecially ſeeing no mortal men can produce a <hi>patent</hi> from him for the inſtitution of any other: and why ſhould we think the omiſſion of the Croſs in Baptiſm undecent? ſeeing it was omitted by Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles; for that it was omitted by them, is confeſſed by a learned Conformiſt, Dr. <hi>Fulk,</hi> in anſwer unto the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 252. <q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the ſign of the Croſſe, ſaith he, in any eſtimation with the Apoſtles, or the faithful in their time. <hi>Tertullian</hi> indeed, reckoneth ſigning with the Croſſe to be an old Tradition, which yet is no more certain to have been uſed by the Apoſtles, than other like Ceremonies which he there nameth, as the taſting of Milk and Honey by them that were baptiſed, and the abſtinence from waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a week after baptiſm, oblations for birth dayes, and ſuch other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>long ſince aboliſhed, which they ſhould not have been, if they had been ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtles as neceſſary for Chriſtian Religion. As a man runneth to the Fountain, ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when the channels are defiled, ſo muſt we repair to the practiſe of the firſt Church, which is the Fountain of all piety: <hi>non eſt attendendum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quid aliquis ante nos faciendum putaverit, ſed quid, qui ante omnes eſt, Chriſtus fecerit, &amp; faciendum praeceperit.</hi>
                  </q>  Agreeable hereunto is that which Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> part. 1. pag. 100. quotes out of <hi>Sadeel</hi> againſt the Monks of <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> 
                  <q>When the Monks of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> affirm the ſigns which are added to Baptiſme, are an ornament to it, we thus reply: Are they wiſer than Chriſt Jeſus, who hath ordained his Sacrament in ſo great purity and ſimplicity, and who knoweth better than all the men in the world, what ornament was fitteſt for it? If it be but the covenant of a man, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, no man abrogateth it, or addeth any thing to it: What arrogancy is it then to adde to the inſtitution of Chriſt?</q>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond exception of the Non-conformiſts againſt the Teſtimonies of the Fathers for the ſign of the Croſſe, is, that they doe not contribute ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:137084:14"/>thereunto, as the ſuſpected infamous birth and original of it doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit: In all probabilities, ſay they, that Devilliſh Heretick, <hi>Valentinus,</hi> was the firſt Author and Father of it, the firſt that advanced it unto any religious uſe; and this they prove out of <hi>Irenaeus. Parker</hi> part. 1. pag. 75 averreth, that it appeareth by the Text of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that <hi>Valentinus</hi> did uſe the figure of the Croſſe, to expreſſe one of his <hi>Aeones</hi> by; and as <hi>Valentinus</hi> was the Father of it, ſo <hi>Montanus,</hi> ſay they, was the Nurſe of it. Dr. <hi>Fulk,</hi> as I told you, was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant, and no enemy unto the ſign of the Croſſe, ſo he profeſſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his confutation of the Rhemiſts pag. 87. <hi>As for the ſign of the Croſse, ſo it be without ſuperſtition, we can abide well enough.</hi> And yet this man pag. 252. tels us, that <hi>Valentinus the Heretique was the firſt that made any great account of it;</hi> and cites for it too <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as well as the Non-conformiſts.</p>
               <p>A third exception againſt the pretended antiquity of the Croſſe, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Fathers in that behalf, is, that divers Ceremonies <hi>Coëval</hi> with the Croſſe are not urged, but aboliſhed, and yet they were never proſtituted unto ſuch ſuperſtitious and idolatrous abuſes as the Croſſe hath been: And therefore why ſhould the Croſſe be ſuch a Favourite, as to be retained? This exception you may ſee thus managed by <hi>Parker,</hi> part. 1. pag. 39. <q>If our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites muſt needs drink of this Ciſtern of antiquity, then let the

               </p>
               <p>A fourth exception againſthe ancient uſe of the Croſſe by the Fathers, is that it is over-ballanced by the Papiſts abuſe of it unto Idolar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the Croſſe being a <hi>humane invention altogether unneceſſary</hi> in Gods worſhip, is for the Idolattous abuſe of it rightly aboliſhed.

               <p>This weighs little or nothing, unleſſe withall you can prove, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles command of decency enjoyneth, that the ſeate of ſhame in the baptized ſhould be marked with the ſign of the Croſſe, in token that he ſhould not bee aſhamed. Doubtleſſe Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe was ſuitable unto his precept, and you doe not, you cannot pretend, that ever hee was ſigned in the forehead with the ſign of the Croſſe, either by himſelf or any other: he propounds his example for imitation, and gives this for a reaſon, that his pattern was that of our bleſſed Saviour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Be ye even followers of me, as I alſo am of Christ.</hi> We ſhall not then think that ſo requiſite unto Baptiſme which hee never uſed; ſo ſo long as wee follow ſo great a precedent, wee ſhall not bee much ſollicitous, though we ſwarve from the advice of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that hath no warrant from the Word of God. <hi>Paul</hi> makes large profeſſions, that he was not aſhamed of the Goſpel, which held forth <hi>a crucified Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 1.16. Phil. 1.20. 2 Tim 1.12. But no man can ſay that he ever expreſſed this his profeſſion by the ſign of the Croſſe; and therefore we ſhall make no other account of the Signe of the Croſſe, than as of a <hi>ſupernumerarie</hi> in Gods ſervice; and thoſe Beleevers that want it, may have confidence when Chriſt ſhall appear, and not be aſhamed before him at his comming, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you think we muſt ſtoop unto the bare words of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> though not ſeconded with any reaſon; and this is more then <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe would have expected from us: for after this manner the holy Scriptures alone are to be entertained, as Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> proveth againſt <hi>Harding,</hi> Def.

               <p n="1">1. I ſhall in general ſay unto them three things.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Many Miracles were wrought by the Brazen Serpent; <hi>for it came to paſs, that if a Serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the Serpent of Braſſe, he lived,</hi> Numb. 21.9.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the former uſe of the ſign of the Croſſe in Miracles, obligeth not to a uſe of it (now all miraculous uſe thereof is by the generall confeſſion of Proteſtants ceaſed) may be gathered, in a way of Analogie and proportion from what the above-mentioned Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> ſpeaks, pag. 58. of Spittle and Oyle: <hi>We confeſs that spittle was uſed by our Saviour Chriſt, in healing of the dumb; and oyle by the Apoſtles, in curing of many other diſeaſes; yet both miraculouſly: but to imitate the work of a Miracle without the miraculous power, is but an apiſh</hi>

               <p n="1">1. You ſay that the uſage of this Ceremony of ſigning with the Croſſe, was we alſo know, frequent in the Church (while the gifts of healing continued) in curing diſeaſes.

                  <q>In the ſame Town one <hi>Innocentia</hi> a moſt religious woman, and one of the principal in the City, had a Canker on her breaſt, a kind of ſore which the Phyſitians told her is utterly uncurable: wherefore they uſe either to cut the infected part away, or for the prolonging of the life a little while in ſome eaſe, the malady is to be aſſwaged and mitigated with frequent plaiſters; for the opinion of Hippocrates will induce us to beleeve, that death wil thence inſue, though ſomewhat ſlowly: for hee, as they ſay, doth adviſe to omit all attempt of curing it; this a skilfull Phyſitian her familiar friend told her; ſo that now ſhe ſought help of none but the Lord, who told her in a dreame, that <hi>Eaſter</hi> next, which then drew near, ſhe ſhould mark on the womans ſide by the Font, what woman ſhe was, that, being then baptized, ſhould firſt meet her, and that ſhe ſhould intreat her to ſigne her ſore with the ſigne of the Croſſe of Chriſt: She did it, and was cured.</q>

               <p>Your ordinary Readers will thinke you Conjure, when they hear you term Baptiſme an exorciſing of Devils; for they never heard of any Exorciſme in Baptiſme, ſave of the Papiſts, which our Divines brand for Magical; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this expreſſion might not have been forborn to avoyd all appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, in complyance with Papiſts in their uſe of Exorciſme.

               <p>But yet notwithſtanding all this, it is very well known, by all that know the difference betwixt the Predicaments, that the Sacrament of Baptiſme cannot be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:137084:20"/>ſaid to be the Exorciſing of Devils, the reſcuing of a perſon from the power of Satan, the delivery of him from the tyranny, otherwiſe than in <hi>an improper, tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, and metonymicall praedication,</hi> viz. as it is a ſign and ſeal, and if you will, <hi>a moral inſtrument of the conditionall promiſe thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what advantage reap you unto your cauſe by this? why unto this Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of Devils, the reſcuing a perſon from the power of Satan into Gods fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the uſe of the Croſſe in Baptiſme is exactly ſymbolical? Your argument (if there be any argument in your words) as I conceive, ſtands thus: That which is ſo exactly ſymbolical unto any thing ſigned, ſealed, conveighed, and exhibited in Baptiſme, is ſo decent, as that the omiſſion thereof would be undecent: but the uſe of the Croſſe in Baptiſme is exactly ſymbolical unto that which is ſigned, ſealed, and conveighed, or exhibited in Baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> the Exorciſing of Devils, the reſcuing a perſon from the power of Satan into Gods Sonſhip and Family, therefore the uſe of it is ſo decent, as that the omiſſion thereof would be undecent; you cannot but expect that the <hi>Major</hi> will be denied, and 'tis very ſtrange that you leave it deſtitute of all proof; for you cannot be ignorant if you have read the Non-conformiſts, whom you oppoſe, that their great quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Ceremonies, was their ſymbolicalneſſe and myſtical ſignification; their arguments againſt which you may read at large in the <hi>Abridgement,</hi> page 41, 42, <hi>&amp;c. uſque ad</hi> 49. <hi>Ames his Reply to Mortons Generall Def.</hi> page 33, 34, <hi>&amp;c. uſque ad</hi> 58.

               <p>But, Sir, you may thinke to blow off all the Arguments with a ſilent ſcorne and contempt, and this indeed many doe with thoſe arguments which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer; but if you will not vouchſafe to read theſe Authors, if you pleaſe to accept of my ſervice, I will abridge the ſubſtance of their arguments, and attend your anſwer unto them.</p>
               <p>Then, for the <hi>Minor,</hi> I have four things to ſay unto it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Baptiſme it ſelf is more proper, agreeable, or exactly Symbolical, unto the reſcuing of a perſon from the power of Satan into Gods Sonſhip and Family, than the ſigne of the Croſſe; and therefore the ſign of the Croſſe in Baptiſme is a ſuperfluous ſupernumerary, like the dimme and ſmoakie light of a candle in the preſence of the clear and glorious light of the Sun at noon-day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Popiſh Exorciſme and Exſufflation are as, if not more, proper, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and exactly ſymbolical, unto the Exorciſing of Devils as the uſe of the Croſſe in Baptiſme, and they have not been ſo much abuſed as it, and may as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be purged from all Superſtition and Idolatry, and therefore you may as well conclude concerning them as the Croſs, that they are ſo decent as that the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them would be undecent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I much queſtion whether or no two croſſe motions of a finger or a thumb be ſo proper, agreeable, and exactly ſymbolical, unto ſo high, dreadfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a myſtery, as the delivery of us from the power of Satan and darkneſſe, and the tranſlation of us into the kingdome of the dear Son of God, as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; and I ſhall hardly beleeve you, unleſſe you bring other proofs, beſides the Hyperbolies of the Fathers.</p>
               <p>As for that which in confirmation of the <hi>Minor,</hi> you quote out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is urged by ſome, not onely for the <hi>ſignification,</hi> but alſo for the <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:137084:20"/>and efficacy of the Croſſe,</hi> and whether you will go ſo far I cannot tell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unto it Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> when urged by Papiſts for Traditions, gives this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Tom. 1. pag. 390. <hi>At anima ſide contra Satanam munienda eſt, non cruce. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres quidem ſe hoc ſigno adverſus Daemonas munitos eſſe putârunt, ſed hoc ex haereſi Montani fluxit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of him Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> pag. 125, gives this deſerved character; <hi>He was one ſo exactly qualified, that the Profeſsors</hi> Chair <hi>may ſeem made for him, and he for it, they mutually ſo fitted each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I would deſire to know, how you like the companion of the Croſſe in Tertullian, the holy oile? <hi>caro ungitur,</hi> ſaith he, in the words immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, <hi>ut anima conſecretur:</hi> but perhaps you are for the reviving of that, as well as for the uſing of the Croſſe; and ſome ſtick not to ſay, that 'tis as ancient as the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>One thing more I cannot but remember you of, before I leave this Section, and it is a <hi>diſtinction of myſtical ſignification</hi> by the learned and reverend <hi>Morton,</hi> the word <hi>mystical ſignification hath two acceptions,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>General Def.</hi> pag. 52. The one <hi>Sacramental,</hi> by ſignification of grace conferred by God; the other is onely <hi>Moral,</hi> by ſignification of mans duty and obedience towards God. <hi>The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which we defend</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are onely myſtical Moral, not Sacramental;</hi> and for his diſclaiming theſe, he gives this reaſon, page 53, 54. <hi>A ſacramental ſign (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſacramental, ſo likewiſe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a ſeal of Gods promiſes,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> as the Apoſtle calleth Circumciſion) is alwaies founded upon the expreſſe Covenant of God, therefore none but the Author of the Covenant may inſtitute or appoint any ſuch ſign. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall undertake to adde a ſeal unto the Will and Covenant of any Teſtator amongſt men, is forthwith held</hi> Falſarius, <hi>and thereby made obnoxious to the Law, and lyable to the grievous judgements of man: How much more damnable an Act were it for any to affix any ſign, properly Sacramental, unto the Teſtament of our Lord Jeſus? which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall attempt to do, becommeth guilty of ſacrilegious depravation of the bleſsed My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you make the ſign of the Croſſe to be that which <hi>Morton</hi> calls a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſigne; for he deſcribes a Sacramental ſigne to be that which ſignifieth Grace conferred by God: &amp; is not the reſcuing of a perſon from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan into Gods Sonſhip and Family (as for your other expreſſion: Baptiſme is the Exorciſing of Devils, I am not much delighted with the repetition of it) a grace conferred by God? and unto this you ſay the ſign of the Croſſe is exactly Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, and therefore a Sacramental ſign.</p>

               <p>Here the argument to prove the perfect decency of the uſage of the ſigne of the Croſſe in Baptiſm, is the frequent religious uſe of it amongſt the ancients; I ſay the <hi>religious uſe,</hi> becauſe we oppoſe not the <hi>civil uſe</hi> of it in Coins and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. You know, it is generally denyed by the Non-conformiſts, that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of the Croſſe amongſt the Ancients was lawfull and juſtifiable, and untill this bee cleared, your argument will bee little better than <hi>Petitio principii.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="3">3. I demand whether the uſe of the Croſſe amongſt the Ancients was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or undecent? If it was decent, then why was it abrogated? If it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, then how can you infer therefrom, the perfect decency of the uſe of the Croſſe in Baptiſm?</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:137084:21"/>the Chriſtian ſouldiers wearing a Crown or Garland on their heads, when they receive their Donative; <hi>He was a Montaniſt, and an enemy unto the Church, for condemning that prophetical spirit, which</hi> Montanus <hi>and his followers did boaſt they had received, as if in them Chriſt had performed his laſt premiſe; as if to then he had ſent the Spirit, that ſhould be their perfecter and final inſtructer in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſtian truth. Which exulceration of mind made them apt to take all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of contradiction.

               <p n="3">3.

This Hiſtory of <hi>Palladius</hi> hath the name <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaca,</hi> from one <hi>Lauſus,</hi> to whom it is dedicated both by <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Heraclides.</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> both which Epiſtles dedicated to <hi>Lauſus,</hi> are prefixed to this Hiſtory. The Hiſtory hath more Miracles in it than are in the New Teſtament, and as ſtrange ones as are in any Legend, and it ſeemeth the Author, (as he ſaith at the 56. Sect. of this Hiſtory) could have reported ſtranger, but that they did <hi>excedere miraculi modum;</hi> not that they were falſe though, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men wanted faith to believe them. In the firſt Sect one <hi>Dorotheus, cum prius ſignaculo crucis ſe muniviſſet,</hi> draweth, and drinketh the water of a Well, wherein there were Aſps: Abbot <hi>Copres,</hi> ſect. 49. went into the flames of a great fire, and ſtaid there half an hour, and had no hurt, but as he entred the fire he was <hi>in nomine Chriſti ſignatus.</hi> One Abbot <hi>Be,</hi> at the entreaty of ſome Husbandmen of that Country, commanded a Sea horſe <hi>(Hipp-potamus)</hi> who

And ſo forthwith this Sea horſe, as if he had been driven away by an Angell, aniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>omnino evanuit.</hi> Sect. 17. An Hyaena brings her whelpe unto Abbot <hi>Macarius</hi> and layeth it down at the Abbots feet, this whelp was blind, the Abbot ſpits upon the eyes of this blind whelp, prayeth, and the whelp recovereth its ſight; the <hi>Hyaena</hi> taketh up the whelp, and deparreth: But then the next day the ſame <hi>Hyaena</hi> bringeth a great ſheep-skin unto the Abbot, offereth it unto him (belike as a token of her thankfulneſs for the cure) the Abbor refuſeth the preſent, rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Hyaena</hi> for killing the ſheep, adviſeth her to kill no more ſheep, the <hi>Hyaena, capite ſuo annuit, ut quae ſancto Macario aſſentiretur,</hi> Saith my Authour: up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on the report of St. <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in another Place, the Divell in the habit of a Presbyter offereth the Sacrament to one, but the good Presbyter diſcovereth the Divell, and defies him, and his Sacrament. In another place one liveth many yeares, and had no other ſuſtenance, but the Sacrament once every Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Reader is, I hope, ſufficiently ſatisfied, that your Author <hi>Palladius</hi> is a Legendary writer, the Gentlemen who have made this ſearch for me, deſire for the preſent, to have their names concealed, but however they will be reſponſible for what they have written, when ever you ſhall be pleaſed to call them to an account.</p>
                     <p>A third witnes is the Author of the Queſt. and Reſp. aſcribed to <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> but this Author is unknown, and the book a forgery, unworthy of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and as ſhort of his former writings as Lead is of Gold, this you know a great deal better then my ſelf, but others may ſee as much demonſtrated by <hi>Rivet.</hi> Critie. ſacr. lib. 2. cap. 5.

The Judges upon the Bench, or the Lords at their coming to Parliament, are a ſufficient evidence of this, who weare not thoſe Robes in common occaſions, which there they do, as betokening their quality. and the imployments they are about. And then what is thus cuſtomary in civill matters (viz, to difference perſons and imployments, yea and dayes, by diſtinction of garments) and is allowed to be decent therein, this by analogy undeniable, is as fitly and decently from thence derived to ſolemne ſacred actions alſo, ſuch are the publick offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Prieſt: and the commands of our Superiours being added to this decency of the matter,</hi>

               <head>Jeanes.</head>
               <p>The Surplice was uſed not onely as <hi>a note of diſtinction,</hi> but alſo for <hi>its myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſignification,</hi> to betoken ſanctity of life, and untill this latter uſe of them be proved lawfull, your four arguments will be but a begging of the Queſtion, as you will ſoon perceive, when you attempt the reducing of them into forme.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for anſwer unto all your arguments; but I ſhall alſo give unto each of them a ſeveral anſwer.</p>
               <p>The firſt argument is taken from the Analogy betwixt civill and ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and actions: Civil perſons wear ſolemn garments for ſolemn actions, which they doe not uſe at other times; therefore it is decent for Miniſters to weare ſolemne garments in their ſolemne ſacred actions, which they doe not uſe in common occaſions, as whilſt they are walking in the ſtreets, or the like.</p>
               <p>To anſwer this, I need not trouble my ſelf, but only referre the Reader unto what <hi>Ames</hi> anſwereth unto the like objection of Biſhop <hi>Mortons</hi> in his Reply to his particular Def. &amp;c pag. 4. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">1. That if all this be granted, yet it maketh not for the Surplice; which is not a Civil but an Eccleſiaſtical, Religious habit; there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a grave, civil habit, and a myſtical garment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conſequence doth not follow; becauſe in the exerciſing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial duty, nothing is requiſite which the Lord himſelfe doth not impoſe upon his Miniſters. A Miniſter then hath another perſon, than when he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſtreet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a great diſparity betwixt Judges and Miniſters, in regard of their Functions; for Judges Functions are civill, and therefore ſubject unto mans Inſtitutions: but Miniſters in their Functions are onely to obſerve what he, whoſe ſervice they are to perform hath appointed.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This anſwer fits your argument, as if it had been purpoſely made for it, and by this the Reader may ſee, that it was baffled long agoe, and methinkes you ſhould not have propounded it anew without ſome reinforcement.</p>
               <p>But your ſecond argument will ſtrike the matter dead; The Command of our Superiours added unto the decency of the matter. But this mends the matter nothing at all; for our Superiours, as well as others, are prohibited to make any additionals unto the Worſhip inſtituted by the ſupream Law giver, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdome, and ſo could ſufficiently provide whatſoever was fitting in his own Worſhip and Service: All additions unto the Ceremonial Law under the Old Teſtament were unlawfull, Deut. 12.32. And why then ſhould it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:137084:24"/>to adde unto the Ceremonial Law in the New Teſtament? <hi>Chriſt was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Houſe of God, as Moſes,</hi> Heb. 3.2. and therefore his proviſion for <hi>rituals</hi> was as perfect and exact, though not as numerous.</p>
               <p>Your third Argument, The reſemblance of the Surplice unto thoſe Garments which in Scripture are mentioned for the like ſolemnities, long, ſhining, white Robes or Garments, I ſuppoſe you mean ſome of the holy Garments of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that were appointed for glory and for beauty, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.4. and then this reaſon may involve the Surplice in the guilt of Judaiſme, rather than prove its decency. Hath God, think you, abrogated thoſe myſtical Garments that were of his owne inſtitution, to make way for ſuch as ſhall bee of mens invention: If we muſt needs have myſtical apparel, what can be more fitting than that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ordained?</p>
               <p>The Word and Sacraments doe ſufficiently minde a Miniſter of his duty, and the light of them is ſo full and clear, like that of the Sun, as that it needs not the candle of a Surplice. This inſtruction of the Church by humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is to teach her with a Feſcue, to hide the light of the Goſpel under a buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and it is a vailing and ſhadowing of its brightneſſe.</p>
               <p>Some have concluded the Surplice to be decent, becauſe the Angels appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>ſhining garments,</hi> Luk. 24.4. <hi>in raiment white as ſnow,</hi> Mat. 28.3. becauſe the glorious Saints in heaven are <hi>cloathed with white robes,</hi> Revel. 7.9. and the Lambs Wife <hi>ſhall be arraied with fine linnen,</hi> clean, <hi>white,</hi> Revel. 19.8. But theſe inferences are, as they ſay, <hi>à baculo ad angulum,</hi> and you are wiſer than to own them, and yet the ſtrength of your argument is little, if at all, ſuperiour to them.</p>
               <p>Your fourth argument is, the conſtant uſage of other Churches, beſides this of ours, Eaſtern as well as Weſtern, for many Centuries together.</p>
               <p>But firſt, the not uſing the Surplice by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſome Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures immediately following their times, is a ſafer preſident to imitate, than the uſage of it in ſucceeding Centuries, which were not ſo pure and incorrupt as the Primitive time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe which are utterly unskilled in the Ancients, may collect from the confeſſion of your great and learned <hi>Hooker, Eccleſiaſtical Politie,</hi> pag. 245. That the true and Primitive antiquity of the Surplice, is a matter very doubtful, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſaith he, I am not bent to ſtand ſtiffly upon theſe probabilities, that in <hi>Hieromes</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> times any ſuch attire, as a white garment, was made ſeveral unto this purpoſe, to wit, for Miniſters to execute their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in, and it is without doubt that in the next age, the cumberſome weight of Ceremonies, as you call it, burdened the Church; for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who lived in the times of <hi>Hierome</hi> complained hereof, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>ad Januar. Quamvis enim neque hoc inveniri poſſit, quomodo contra fidem ſint, ipſam tamen religionem, quam pauciſſimis &amp; manifeſtiſſimis celebrationum Sacrament is miſericordia Dei eſſe liberam voluit, ſervilibus oneribus premunt, ut tolerabilior ſit conditis Judaeorum, qui etiam ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempus libertatis non agnoverint, legalibus tamen ſarcinis, non humanis praeſumptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ſubjiciuntur. Sed eccleſia Dei inter multam paleam multaque zizania constituta multa tolerat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place you averre, that Eccleſiaſtical cuſtome in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a more rational ground and rule of decency then any Mr. <hi>J.</hi> or <hi>Ameſius</hi> to boote, will readily be able to produce, for the rejecting of them, &amp;c. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Ameſius</hi> his argument againſt things of this nature, <hi>humane myſtical ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:137084:25"/>be anſwered, this compariſon with impartial Readers will paſſe for nothing but vapouring.</p>
               <p>In the end of the Section, you give a hint of the tolerableneſſe of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they were <hi>bands which tyed no harder yoke than this, upon your ſhoulders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt, God hath broken the yoke of his own Ceremonies, and our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates cannot ſhew us any commiſſion for their pretended authority to make a new yoke of their own, and with it to gall the necks and conſciences of Chriſts Members and Miniſters. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he thought all indifferent things to be lawfull, yet he profeſſeth that he would not be brought under the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. Now we were brought under the power of the Croſſe and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice; for as <hi>Aquinas</hi> rightly, <hi>qui utitur eo, quod non expedit, ſive licitum ſive illici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, redigitur quedammodo ſub rei illius poteſtate,</hi> and we were enthralled unto the uſe of them, when they were not expedient, when they did not edify, but deſtroy and ſcandalize.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we may judge of the late Biſhops zeal by their puniſhments, they ſhewed more zeal againſt the neglect of their Ceremonies, than againſt the omiſſion of the weightieſt matter of both the Law and Goſpel; the moſt ſcandalous and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Miniſters found more favour at their Tribunals, than ſuch of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts as were renowned for parts and learning, and exemplary for perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal piety and diligence in their Miniſterial function.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their rigour in impoſing theſe bands was unexcuſable and unſupportable; for it was upon no leſſe penalties than ſilencing and deprivation, and theſe were upon the moſt peaceable and conſcientious Diſſenters: and when theſe arguments ſatisfied them not (and they were the beſt arguments their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories yeelded) the poor men were judged obſtinate and contumacious, and then the Secular power was called upon for their perpetual impriſonment, they muſt not breath in Engliſh aire, unleſſe in the cloſe, and perhaps infected one, of a ſtinking priſon; and there they muſt rot and expire, except they conform againſt their conſciences: But I hope the Prelates ſufferings have awakened them unto a ſight of, and ſorrow for this their over ſeverity, if not, I ſhall pray unto God to open their ears, that they may hear the voice of his rod.</p>

               <p>Here we have a groſſe miſtake, and a bitter jeer.</p>

               <p>Next we have a bitter jeere at Non conformiſts, as if their opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane, religious Ceremonies, were ſo filly and ridiculous, that Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> deſpiſed it, and ſmiled at it, and could refute it eaſily, by trifling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by unbuttoning and buttoning his Caſſock: There may be truth in this your relation concerning Mr. <hi>Hynde</hi> and <hi>Glapthorne,</hi> but your falſe accuſation of <hi>Ames</hi> will render your bare word queſtionable, if it be not backed with farther proofs; but ſuppoſe your relation true, yet all that you can gather hence is, that they were weak Reſpondents, and knew not the ſtate of the Queſtion; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that you ſeem as great a ſtranger as they, for you dare not ſay that Biſhop <hi>Mortons buttoning and unbuttoning his Caſſock, was a religious Ceremony,</hi> and if it were not, was it not a proper <hi>medium</hi> to prove the lawfulneſſe of humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ceremonies?</p>
               <p>The Non conformiſts layd downe four qualifications in the Ceremonies which they oppoſe: 1. Humane Inſtitution. 2. Ordained ſignification. 3. My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſignification. 4. Appropriation unto Gods ſolemne Worſhip and Service.</p>

And I am confident that your deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Ames,</hi> will adde nothing unto your conqueſts; it appears by your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of him, that as yet, you never read him, and yet you have undertaken to cenſure and refute him, and in order hereunto have adventured upon uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjectures or ſurmiſes that have proved ground leſſe and to have no footing in his Writings; and now as for his Argument from the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. you elevate and deride it, before you know what it is, and thus you triumph over on enemy that you never yet looked in the face; but for your conviction, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſatisfaction, I have prevailed with the Stationer for the Printing of the paſſages quoted in <hi>Ames,</hi> and unto them ſhall onely prefix this Preface; <hi>Let not him that girdeth on his harneſse boast himſelf, as hee that putteth it off,</hi> 1 King. 20.11.</p>

                  <p>This Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.40. being rightly underſtood, doth not onely not juſtifie ſuch Ceremonies as ours, but plainly condemneth them. For the manifeſting of which aſſertion, becauſe it may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe eares that are accuſtomed to other ſounds, I will here diſtinctly ſet down an Argument drawn out of theſe words, againſt ſuch Ceremonies as ours are.</p>
                  <p>All that is left unto the Churches liberty in things pertaining unto Gods Worſhip, is to order them in comely manner. This is manifeſtly collected one of that place in queſtion. So the Defendant ſeemeth to grant, ſo <hi>P. Martyr</hi> underſtandeth it, as is to be ſeen in his Commentary upon 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. which judgement of his is cited and approved by Dr. <hi>Whitaker de Font.</hi> pag. 841. &amp; 844. confirmed alſo by <hi>Junius</hi> againſt <hi>Bellarmine, Cont.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 86, 87. &amp; <hi>c,</hi> 17. <hi>n.</hi> 9, 10, 12, 13. where he ſheweth that Chriſt is the onely Law giver, that appointeth things in his Church; and that he hath appointed all that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; and that the Church maketh no Laws (properly ſo called) to appoint any new things to be uſed, but onely Canons, Orders, Directions, ordering in ſeemly manner thoſe things which Chriſt hath appointed; and that if ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any thing of her own, ſhee doth de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>line. The reaſon is becauſe unto her is committed no authority of appointing new things, but a Miniſtery to obſerve and doe ſuch things which Chriſt hath appointed. <hi>Vide etiam Jun. de tranſl. imper. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 26, 27.31. This is alſo confirmed by ſound reaſon, both in reſpect of the wiſdome required; and in all Law-makers, and perfectly found in Chriſt, and alſo in regard of the nature of ſuch Inſtitutions.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:137084:28"/>For the former reaſon teacheth (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſheweth Rhet: 1.3) that all, which poſſibly may, ſhould be appointed in the law, by the giver of it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left unto the miniſteriall judges, but that which muſt needs be left, as matters of fact, &amp;c. Now in the worſhip of God, all but particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of order, may eaſily be appointed (as in very deed they were) by our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver Chriſt. As for the nature of ſuch inſtitutions, that doth alſo require ſo much: for whatſoever is above civility therein, if it be not a circumſtance of order, it is worſhip, and therefore invented by man, unlawfull will worſhip. For whatſoever is uſed, or acted by him that worſhipeth God, in that act, it muſt needs be either grounded on civill humane conſiderations, and therefore civility: or an act and mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By all this it may appear, that the authority of the Church is not to appoint what ſhe will, no not of things in their own nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſay they be in order, or for order: But only to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus farre the propoſition, or firſt part of my Syllogiſme: the aſſumption followeth.</p>
                  <p>But to appoint and uſe the Ceremonies as we do, is not to order in comely manner any thing pertaining to Gods worſhip. The reaſon is, becauſe order requireth not the inſtitution or uſage of any new thing, but only the right placing and diſpoſing of things which are formerly inſtituted. This appeareth</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And yet here upon this nothing, it pleaſeth him to accuſe, not onely the Repl. but theſe men, of haughtie and magiſtral faſhions, gulling, and deceiving, great and ſhamefull ſinne, and the poor Repl. at the leaſt, for a man deſtitute of common honeſty.

                  <p>Omitting therefore unneceſſary repetition, let us hear the reaſons of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſhoneſty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Junius</hi> cap 16 <hi>n.</hi> 86, 87. ſaith onely firſt, that thoſe humane Laws are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary in the Church, which tend to this, that all things may be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That theſe are improperly called Laws in the Church, being more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Conſtitutions., or Canons.</p>
                  <p>Now out of the firſt ſaying, the Repl. concluded, that <hi>Junius</hi> did judge the Apoſtle left no more to the Churches liberty, than to order Gods Ordinances in decent manner: And out of the ſecond he inferred the ſame concluſion; becauſe any conſtitution, above ordering in decent manner that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was injoyned, is properly a Law. What extraordinary diſhoneſty is here?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Junius</hi> c. 17. n. 9. ſaith onely, that to make new Laws in divine things, is to decline, <hi>i. e.</hi> in points of Faith, or neceſſary rules of Sanctimony. But <hi>Iunius</hi> maketh no mention at all, either of Faith or Sanctimony, or Neceſſity, nor <hi>Bell.</hi> himſelf in that place. Neither is the queſtion there handled of points of Faith, or things abſolutely neceſſary to Sanctimony. All double, treble Ceremonies reductively Sacramentall, and Worſhip, are by the Rej. his owne dictates double ſacred; and that is it which <hi>Iunius</hi> meaneth by divine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Bell.</hi> ſaith that the addition forbidden <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. is of Laws contrary to the Law of God: Whereunto <hi>Junius, n.</hi> 10. anſwereth, that any Laws at all, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Gods Laws, are contrary to the Law of God, ſpeaking of proper Laws, without any backing of Gods Law, binding the conſcience, as he ſheweth, cap. 16. n. 86.8.</p>
                  <p>Here 1. the Rejoind. left out thoſe words of <hi>Iunius,</hi> neither contrary nor beſide the word; which if he had tranſtated, then the Readers memory might have recalled, how this place cited before for defence of that phraſe, was but ſhifted by the Rejoind. pag 42.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to be marked that the Def. and Rej. their anſwer unto <hi>Deut</hi> 4. is the ſame with <hi>Bell.</hi> pag. 134.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That expoſition of Laws without backing, is of the Rej. his own forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. No ſuch thing is found in the places quoted, nor yet did <hi>Bell.</hi> profeſſe to defend any ſuch thing. Of binding the conſcience, enough hath been ſaid in the head of difference betwixt our Ceremonies and Popiſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Iunius n.</hi> 12. anſwering to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his ſaying, that God (in the N.T.) gave onely the common Laws of Faith and Sacram. leaving the ſpecials to the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> affirmeth Gods Laws to be perfect <hi>re, ratione &amp; modo,</hi> and thoſe of the Church to be but Canons and diſpoſings of conveniency, for better obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of divine Laws.</p>
                  <p>Where note 1. an example of an &amp;c. for a blind, or blinding, which the

Note alſo, Secondly, that <hi>Junius</hi> doth not in this place mention Canons, as the Rejoynd, pleaſeth to alter his words in reciting of them; But cautions and diſpoſitions. Now a caution about the performance of any thing, is not an inſtitution of a new thing. 3. <hi>Jun.</hi> is found to ſay as much as he was alledged for, and to the contrary we have from the Rejoynd. <hi>an hil di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now out of all theſe allegations, the Rejoynd. maketh his interrogatories.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where be theſe words, all that is requiſite as ſpoken of Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> the ſenſe of theſe words, as ſpoken of all Ceremonies above meer order and decency, is <hi>cap.</hi> 16, 28.</p>

                  <p>As for a Patent to appoint double, treble, ſacred ceremonies, it is a vain thing for them to plead it, that cannot ſhew it under the great Seal.

For 1. many affirmative Commandements of God there are, which in extraordinary caſes cannot bee fulfilled, and ceaſe to bind, as praying unto, and praiſing of God with our voice; which is no ſnare to him that cannot ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>The appointing of Wine for the Supper, is no ſnare, though ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have it not, and ſome men cannot well drink it. See <hi>Beza</hi> Ep. 2. <hi>Pareus</hi> and <hi>Symb. Sacram. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.2. I would know, whether it had been a ſnare if God had appointed ſitting at the Table with exception of ſuch extraordinary caſes? if yea, then much more when men appoint kneeling, ſurplicing, and croſſing; if no, then our argument may proceed.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling in publique prayer might have been appointed without ſnaring, as appearing before the Lord thrice in the year, was appointed to every Male in Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.16. For (without doubt) many men in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were, by accident more unable to travel up to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then any Chriſtian that hath knees, is to kneel.</p>
                  <p>After this obſervation, of which the Rej<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith it may be as wee will, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that our Lord hath left nothing abſolute to the will of his Officers; but hath left even ambulatory Rites, under generall rules, which will tye them as perfectly, as if every one had been named and with leſſe cumber.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But this is nothing to the purpoſe; becauſe ſo the imperfecteſt Law that is in any Nation upon the earth, if it be worthy the name of Law, leaveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo abſolute to the will of inferiour Officers, as that it ſhould be without the general rules of Juſtice, common good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay not without the rules of order and decency.</p>

But if hee meane, that a generall rule is as fit and full for the direction of us imperfect men, as particulars are, then I think no man conſcious of humane frailty, wil beleeve him.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe I beleeve, that he himſelf is ſo fully perſwaded in croſſing the baptized, by any rule which he hath out of Gods word for that, as hee is for baptizing by the rule of that.</p>

                     </gap>epl. having (as he thought) ſufficiently grounded the generall, that a perfect Law leaveth nothing more then needs muſt unto inſeriour officers, goeth on to aſſume, that in the worſhip of God, all, but particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of order, might eaſily be (as indeed they were) appointed by Chriſt, and therefore need not be left to the Churches wiſdom. Upon this it pleaſeth the Rej. to ſay little to the purpoſe, in many words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſaith, that circumſtances of order were not harder to determine than thoſe of decency. Now it is plaine enough that the Repl, here, naming order, did alſo underſtand decency, though he named order only.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:137084:32"/>
                  <p n="2">2. He asketh, what School of Divinity hath taught the <hi>Repl.</hi> to ſay, that our Lord forbore the determining of ſuch circumſtances, becauſe all elſe was eaſie? I anſwer, no rule of Divinity did ever teach the <hi>Repl.</hi> to ſay ſo, nor yet the Rejoinder to impute unto him, what he never ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But if he meaneth (as it ſeemeth he doth) becauſe it was not ſo eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine circumſtances of time and place, as real worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I then anſwer, that this (as I think) the Replyer learned out of that Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity School, out of which the Def. and Rejoinder learned. That which they cite out of <hi>Calvin, pag.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Junius</hi> is cited to the contrary out of <hi>Cont.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>n.</hi> 12. (which place the Rejoinder looked upon by occaſion of the Replyer his former citation of it) But he in that very place, diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Laws, properly ſo called, and cautions, leaving onely cautions to the Churches liberty, which is the very ſame that the Repl. meaneth. The plaine truth is, that ſuppoſing Gods will to be, we ſhould worſhip him in any place, and at any time fitting, it was neceſſary, that the particular choice of fitting time &amp; place, ſhould be left undetermined to any particular time, or place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively. <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo is cited, as more comely, expreſſing the cauſe to be, that Chriſt would not, than that he could not determine ſuch matters.</p>
                  <p>Now though <hi>Calvin,</hi> being ſo excellent in his expreſſions may eaſily be granted to have expreſſed the ſame meaning in more comely manner than the Repl. Yet here was no cauſe of noting diſparity: For the Repl in ſaying, all things but particular order and decency may bee eaſily appointed, did not ſay what Chriſt could doe, but what might be eaſily for us appointed, or with our eaſe, or with the eaſe which we doe conceive of in Law giving, or of an ordinary Law-giver, having ſuch authority as Chriſt had. And who doth not ſee, that it is not ſo eaſie, to appoint every particular place, and time, wherein God ſhall be worſhipped, throughout all the world, as with that worſhip he ſhall bee ſerved? For that particular deſcription, a thouſand books, ſo great as our own Bible, would not have ſufficed.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. A ſecond reaſon of the Repl. his propoſition, was, that whatſoever in worſhip is above order and decency, is worſhip: Becauſe whatſoever is acted by him that worſhippeth, in that act. beſide ordinary civility, muſt either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ee an act or means of worſhip, or an orderly decent diſpoſing of thoſe acts, or elſe at the leaſt idle, and ſo unlawfull. The Rej. anſwereth 1. that a ſignificant Ceremony for Edification is lawful; yet cometh not under any of thoſe heads. But he himſelf confeſſeth a ſignificant Ceremony inſtituted of God, to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial worſhip, and inſtituted of man to bee worſhip, though not in it ſelfe: of which diſtinction enough hath been ſaid in the head of Worſhip: Yet this by the way: A ſignificant ceremony for edification is the ſame in it ſelfe, by whomſoever it be inſtituted, becauſe inſtitution is extrinſecal to the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and alters it not in it ſelf, internally. If therefore it be eſſentiall law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worſhip, in it ſelfe, when it is inſtituted by God, it is alſo eſſentiall (though not lawfull) worſhip, in it ſelf, when it is inſtituted by man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:137084:32"/>that Ceremony whoſe proper ſole end is edification toward God, is properly done to the honour of God, and ſo properly divine worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His anſwer is, that comelineſs grounded on civil humane conſiderations, is not meere civility, in ſacred actions and uſe, but ſacred by application. Which is very true, if civil application be meant by meer civil; but then it is nothing to the purpoſe. For ſacred by application is ſeemly clothing, put on for to goe to Church in, and yet is in it ſelf meere civil. The Queſtion is not of application, but of internal nature. Sacred things applid to civill buſines, doe not therefore become civill; for who will ſay, that prayer, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Parliament, is a civil act, though it were uſed in the upper and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er houſe, and applied to that civil meeting, as it ought to be? And why then ſhall the application of civil decency unto ſacred buſines, make it alter the nature or name of it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His anſwer is that all meanes of worſhip are not worſhip. But he knew well enough, that this was meant of proper meanes of worſhip.</p>
                  <p>His fourth is, that ordering and manner of diſpoſing is ill divided from comelineſs. Neither did the Repl. intend ſo to divide, but rather to conjoyne them, underſtanding by that manner of diſpoſing, comelineſs. But if the Rej. had not catched up ſome ſhew of confounding comelineſs with order, which was not intended by the Repl. he had been in this argument wholly at a loſſe.</p>
                  <p>His fift and laſt anſwer is, that by <hi>Baſils</hi> leave ſomethings in themſelves, may, and ſometimes muſt be tolerated. But he ſhould have remembred, that the queſtion here is not of tolerating, but of appointing and uſing.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. Thus farre concerning the propoſition of our argument: the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followeth, which is this: To appoint and uſe the Ceremonies as we do, is not to order in comely manner any thing pertaining to Gods worſhip. The reaſon is, becauſe order requireth not the inſtitution or uſage of any new thing, but only the right placing and diſpoſing of things formerly inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoynd, anſwers 1. That order requireth new time, place and meaſure: which is a Sophiſtrie in the propoſition before abuſed, and confuted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 His ſecond is, that ordering in comely manner, or comelineſs, requireth the inſtitution of ſuch formalities, as ſhall be ſutable to the dignity, and variety of divine actions. Where the terme formalities is not ſo formall, that a man may ſpie in it the difference it hath from other things: the Rejoynder in his <hi>Manuduc. pag.</hi> 36. appropriateth it to Biſhops <hi>Rochets, &amp;c.</hi> even as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Surplices: the Biſhops went before the hearſe in their formalities, the Clarkes in their Surplices. So that it ſeemeth to meane ſome Ceremonies of State, and dignity: of which kind neither Croſſe, not ſurplice is any. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the ordering of one thing, doth not require another new thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſing of that one. For if it did, then that new thing (becauſe that alſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:137084:33"/>muſt be ordered) would require another new thing, and that alſo for order ſake another, ſo that no one thing could be ordered without an infinite heape of new things.</p>
                  <p>As for the dignity of divine actions, that is beſt ſuited with mans reverent and humble ſimplicity, not with outward ſhewes of dignity, invented by man. The womans ordinary vail was mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſutable to the dignity of Gods worſhip, then if ſhe had adorned her ſelf with Gold, and pretious Stones. <hi>Pauls</hi> plain Cloak was more ſuitable, then the cheifeſt Cope in all Rome. If order requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth outward ſhewes of dignity, then Rome, which is a confuſed <hi>Babel,</hi> may be to all Churches a mirable example of religious order; for the Councill of <hi>Tient Seſſ.</hi> 22. profeſſeth their Maſſe Ceremonies to be invented, that the majeſty of ſuch a Sacrifice might be ſet out.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. To ſhew further that order requireth not ſuch Ceremonies as ours, the notation of the word was brought in, ſignifying no ſuch thing. Now the Rejoynd, granteth, that originally the word doth not containe within the compaſſe of it, ſuch kind of Ceremonies, though by uſage it may. Which is very true; but helpeth not, Except the Def. or Rejoynd. whoſe princi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is taken from this place, and only retorted by us, can prove, that in this place the word order is extended beyond his originall ſignification. He will not therefore ſtand with us, about the ſignification of the word in this place: let order ſaith he, in this place ſignify no more then placing. But he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his retreat to the word Comelineſſe; asking if comelineſſe be nothing? I anſwer yes, it is ſomething; but the Repl. did not inſiſt on that word, becauſe he took the force of the Def. his argument from this place, principally to lie upon order.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the Rejoynder hath given up Order, I will adde a word or two concerning Comelineſs.</p>
                  <p>I take this for granted, that ſeing the Rejoynder confeſſeth order here to be taken in ſtrict ſignification, as oppoſed only to confuſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. he will alſo conſent with us, that decency, in the ſame place and ſentence, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſtrict ſignification, as oppoſed only to the vice of undecency. Now hence it followeth that decency requireth nothing, but that which is heceſſary to the avoiding of undecency.</p>
                  <p>I ask therefore if undecency in Gods worſhip cannot be avoided, without double, treble, ſacred, ſignificant Ceremonies, of mans inventing? If nor, then the Apoſtles did much forget themſelves, in their publick worſhiping of God, before men had invented ſuch Ceremonies; for that is no anſwer which the Rejoynd. after giveth; all Churches are not bound to this or that particular way of comelineſſe. All Churches are bound to avoid undecency and to doe that which decency requireth, or bindeth them unto. If yea, then Decency doth not require ſuch kind of Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth it indeed, any more then order. So Mr. <hi>Perkins, lat.</hi> to. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 888.

                  <p>I dare appeal to D. <hi>B.</hi> his conſcience, if Baptiſme be not as decently adminiſtred without the Croſſe, as with it,? and publick prayers made as decently without a Surplice, as with it? Let conſcience here ſpeak, and the Rejoynde: harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it, will (without all doubt) confeſſe, that decency in this place doth no more require either Croſſe or Surplice, then order, and that both of them together doth no more require thoſe Ceremonies, then a hundred other, which in England (though not at Rome) are denyed unto them.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Atterſall,</hi> in his ſecond book of the <hi>Sacrament, chap.</hi> 5. ſaith well: if they referre all this traſh and trumpery (of hamane Ceremontes in Baptiſme) to order and comelineſs, as <hi>Hoſius</hi> doth, do they not thereby blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly accuſe the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and of the Apoſtles of uncomelineſſe and diſorder? whereas the comelineſs and dignity of the Sacraments is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by the word of God, by the inſtitution of Chriſt, by the ſimplicity of the Goſpell, and by the practice of the Apoſtles: Nothing is more comely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and orderly, then that which Chriſt commandeth and alloweth: nothing is more uncomely and unſeemly then that which man inventeth in the ſervice of God, and in the celebration of the Sacraments; thereby inverting and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the holy Ordinances of God.</p>

To the Defend, and Rejoynders maintaining ſuch a cauſe, this teſtimony may be given that they would willingly, ſo farre as they can, favour things which the times favour, and therefore ſtrive to make ſomething of that which maketh nothing for them.

               <p>A 3.

               <p>It being thus proved, that even in the Veſtures, Geſtures, and Ceremonies of Gods ſervice, upon ſuppoſition of their lawfulneſſe, the law and light of nature is a principall rule, it will follow that wee may with farre better reaſon ſay of it, than of cuſtome, that 'tis, in the matters ſpoken of, the onely rule of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: For</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. We cannot ſay of Cuſtome, with any truth at all, that it is the onely rule of Decency in the matters before you, wherein Eccleſiaſtical conformity conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, becauſe the onely things excepted from being excluded by the particle <hi>onely,</hi> are things <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> and things <hi>neceſsarily contomitant;</hi> but now the light and law of Nature as it is not <hi>ſubordinate unto cuſtome,</hi> ſo neither is it <hi>neceſſarily concomitant therewith;</hi> for divers cuſtomes in Ceremonies may be, and have been irrational againſt the light and law of Nature: The law and light of Nature then is excluded from being a rule of Decency, by ſaying Cuſtome is the onely rule of Decency.</p>

               <p>The firſt is, that the <hi>duo modi impoſſibile</hi> and <hi>poſſibile</hi> are repeated but once a peece in my Syllogiſme, and in a good Syllogiſme every term is to be put twice.</p>
               <p>The anſwer unto this in breif is, that in a Modal Syllogiſme, the <hi>modus</hi> is none of the terms, but onely a <hi>Syncategorematical</hi> word, ſo <hi>Vallius Introduct.

Neceſſe eſt Petrum eſse hominem. Ergo neceſſe eſt Petrum eſſe animal. Hîc aio, particulam neceſſe, nec habere rationem praedicati, nec ſubjecti, ſed eſſe ex parte copulae, quia in propoſitione, aſſumptione, &amp; concluſione reperitur.

               </p>
               <p>A ſecond objection is, that in the Modal Syllogiſmes mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> this mixture or combination of <hi>impoſſibile</hi> and <hi>poſſibile</hi> is not at all mentioned.</p>
               <p>For anſwer, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> inſtanceth in Modal Syllogiſmes, wherein there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>neceſse</hi> and <hi>contingens,</hi> and Logicians generally hold that <hi>impoſſibile</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto <hi>neceſſarium</hi> and <hi>poſſibile</hi> unto <hi>contingens.</hi> Let two ſpeak for all.</p>

                     </gap> ſomewhat better formed, according to the rules of Logick, and reduced, as near as it can, into a true Syllogiſme. Thus,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever is it ſelf undecent, cannot be the onely rule of Decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But cuſtome is it ſelf undecent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore Cuſtome cannot be the onely rule of Decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here before it can be defined, whether this be a regular Syllogiſme, or no? It muſt bee demanded,</hi> quanta eſt minor, <hi>is the aſſumption univerſal or particular? If it be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, then either the concluſion muſt be particular alſo, or elſe 'tîs a falſe Syllogiſme. And if the concluſion be particular, then it inferres no more, than that ſome undecent cuſtome cannot be the onely rule of decency, which is willingly granted by me, who doe not at all affirm it of undecent cuſtomes. But if the</hi> Minor <hi>be univerſal, then 'tis a falſe propoſition; for certainly all cuſtomes are not indecent. The ſhort is, Nature may bee the rule of one ſort of decency, and Cuſtome the onely rule of another; yet if the cuſtome be in it ſelf indecent, then of ſuch indecent cuſtome it is not pretended, that it is either onely, or at all the rule of decency. And ſo ſtill my propoſition may ſtand good, which as it belonged not to natural decency, ſo much leſse to what is by nature, or in it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, never imagining it reaſonable, that what geſtures were againſt thoſe Laws of Nature, or Scripture, or any other Law of decency, or rather of naturall comelineſſe and honeſty, ſhould by pretenſe of any cuſtome whatever, be introduced into Gods worſhip: 'Tis ſufficient that ſome cuſtomes may bee decent, or in themſelves not indecent, and that all decency in the ſervice of God, is to be regulated and judged of by conformity with them: For I ſaid not, that all cuſtomes were the rule of decency, but that ſome were, and that there was no other rule, but cuſtome: This, I hope, hath diſcovered the invalidity of his ſecond Argument.</hi>

               <p>My Syllogiſme is, as I have demonſtrated, a true Syllogiſme; you might the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> very well have ſpared the paines you have taken to reduce it, as neare as you could, to a true Syllogiſme; for there was no need of it: You deſerve then no thanks for your labour, but I have reaſon to expect reparation from you for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation of my Syllogiſme: This Section therefore I might wholly paſſe over, but yet I ſhall ſtay a while upon the examination of a ſecond reſtriction that you put upon your <hi>dictate:</hi> you have already told us, that it is not to be underſtood of <hi>all decency.</hi> Now you give us to underſtand, that 'tis not meant of <hi>all cuſtoms,</hi> but onely of ſome ſuch as are not undecent; when you ſay cuſtome is the onely rule of decency, your meaning is ſome cuſtomes are the only rule of ſome kind of decency in the Ceremonies of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>But whether this liberty which you aſſume in thus limiting your poſition bee juſtifiable, is very queſtionable; for after this rate, what groſſe abſurdities may any man maintain? If I ſhould ſay, that <hi>ſolum brutum eſt animal:</hi> that a ſpirit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſubſtance: that number onely is quantity: that Baptiſme is the only Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the New Teſtament: would not every one cry out againſt theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions as untrue, as well they might? and doe you thinke they would paſſe for currant? though I ſhould come with an <hi>after game,</hi> and goe about to limit them, in ſuch a manner as you have done, by your aſſertion, and ſay, my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that <hi>ſolum brutum eſt animal irrationale:</hi> that a ſpirit onely is an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:137084:38"/>ſubſtance: that number onely is diſcrete quantity: that Baptiſme is the onely Sacrament of the New Teſtament of initiation; and yet theſe reſtrictions are altogether as fair and allowable as yours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I did not think your propoſition capable of having an <hi>univerſal ſign</hi> affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it; and my reaſon was, becauſe as <hi>Aquinas</hi> p. 1. q. 31. art. 3. obſerveth out of the <hi>Summularii, dictio excluſiva immobilitat terminum cui adjungitur, ut non poſſit fieri ſub eo deſcenſus pro aliquo ſuppoſiterum, non enim ſequitur, ſolus homo is animal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale mortale: Ergo ſolus Socrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding this, I thought your propoſition might be <hi>propoſitio de Idaea,</hi> as they ſay; and ſo, though it were not <hi>formally,</hi> it would be <hi>equivalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> univerſal.</p>
               <p>But now I ſhall lay aſide this conjecture, becauſe you inform us, that your <hi>indefinite propoſition,</hi> was intended by you for a <hi>particular propoſition,</hi> only I ſhall propound ſome objections againſt your making it a particular propoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When you ſay Cuſtome is the only rule of Decency, you ſpeak of Cuſtome either <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>materially;</hi> if you ſpeak of Cuſtome <hi>formally and reduplicativè</hi> as Cuſtome, why then every Cuſtome is a rule of Decency, becauſe <hi>à quatenus ad de omni valet conſequentia,</hi> that which doth agree to a thing as ſuch, doth agree to every ſingular contained under it: but if you ſpeak of Cuſtome only <hi>materially,</hi> and your meaning be, that Cuſtome <hi>ſub tali formali</hi> under ſuch a conſideration or qualification, is the only rule of Decency, why then this <hi>formale,</hi> this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or qualification of Cuſtome, may, with farre better reaſon, be ſaid to bee the importance of the Apoſiles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then according unto Cuſtome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Cuſtome will be but the <hi>materiale</hi> in the rule of Decency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Untill you expréſſe how thoſe ſome Cuſtomes may be qualified, that you make to be the onely rule of Decency, your interpretation of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Let all things be done decently,</hi> will be very obſcure, <hi>explicatio ignoti,</hi> if not <hi>per ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notius,</hi> yet <hi>per aequè ignotum,</hi> and your proof that you bring for your Expoſition will be as dark and doubtſome: Thus both will runne, <hi>Let all things be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome cuſtomes, becauſe ſome cuſtomes are the only rule in ſome things of ſome decency,</hi> whether that which you call the clear importance of the place, do not leave the Reader in an uncertainty, be you your ſelf judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The quantity of indefinite propoſitions may be gathered from their matter; in a neceſſary matter they are univerſal, in a contingent, particular: Now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether to be the <hi>rule of decency</hi> be predicated of cuſtome <hi>neceſſarily</hi> or <hi>contingently?</hi> if <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> then cuſtome cannot but be the rule of decency, and then all cuſtome is a rule of decency: A neceſſary propoſition that is affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, direct, natural, where <hi>ſuperius praedicatur de inferiori,</hi> or <hi>aequale de inaequali,</hi> is alſo <hi>de omni:</hi> if it be predicated of it contingently, then cuſtome may bee, and may not be a rule of decency, and then I deſire you to evidence unto us how cuſtomes being thus a rule of decency, <hi>viz.</hi> contingently, will be a ſolid proof, that the clear importance of the Apoſtles words, Let all things bee done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, is, let all things be done according unto cuſtome? and your beſt and ſpeedieſt way to clear this unto us, will bee by reducing your argument into a Syllogiſme.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If to be a rule of decencie be predicated <hi>contingently</hi> of cuſtome, then cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is onely a fallible rule of decencie, and therefore it needs regulation by a higher rule; and if there be in the Ceremonies of Gods worſhip a higher rule
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:137084:39"/>then cuſtome, it will hereupon inevitably follow, that cuſtome is not in them the onely rule of decency.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You implyedly give us the Character of thoſe Cuſtomes which you affirm to be the only rule of decency, when you ſay, that of ſuch undecent cuſtoms it is not pretended, <hi>that 'tis either only, or at all the rule of decency:</hi> Now all cuſtoms, in the Ceremonies of Gods ſervice, are either decent or undecent: the Cuſtome that is undecent is not at all a rule of decency, and therefore your poſition is to be underſtood of that Cuſtome which is decent: for betwixt <hi>decent and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cuſtomes</hi> in the Ceremonies of Gods ſervice there is no <hi>medium,</hi> as I have ſhewed already: the upſhot of your meaning then is, that ſome Cuſtomes, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are decent, are the onely rule of decency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ſobrietie is in this limitation will appeare, if we will conſider that herein we have a <hi>twofold decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> one in the <hi>rule,</hi> decent cuſtomes; another in the <hi>thing, regulated decency:</hi> The former is different from, and antecedent unto the latter: now of the former decency, in the rule, in cuſtome it ſelf, I demand, <hi>What is the rule of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, whether custome it ſelf, or ſome other thing?</hi> I preſume you will not ſay Cuſtome it ſelf; for then it would be <hi>an underived, unſubordinate, and independent rule,</hi> a rule of it ſelfe: and if you ſhould ſay that ſome other thing beſides cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is the rule of the decency which is in cuſtome, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> by conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, we muſt judge of the decency of Cuſtomes in the Ceremonies of Gods worſhip, whether they be decent or undecent? and from this it is obvious to inferre, that in Ceremonies there is <hi>a rule of decency antecedent unto Cuſtome,</hi> by which Cuſtome it ſelf is to be regulated and meaſured; and therefore Cuſtome is not the onely rule of Decency. Your limitation then is ſo farre from being any ſupport unto your poſition, as that it giveth unto it a plain overthrow.</p>

                  <hi>His laſt argument</hi> [becauſe there is decency in the firſt uſage of ſome things] <hi>falls upon that mistake of my words which I diſcourſed of, and cleared at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for I never ſaid that a thing muſt be caſtomary, before it is decent in any kind: (knowing unqueſtionably that there is a naturall decency) but that the decency of any Ceremony in Gods ſervice, wherein God and Nature have preſcribed nothing particularly, must be regulated according to thoſe meaſures, which the cuſtomes of any place doe allow to be reverentiall among them; or, in yet plainer words, the civil cuſtomes of any nation, by which this or that ſort of geſture is rendered a token of reverence, are the onely rule, by which the decency of indifferent geſtures, &amp;c. is to be judged of, in order to Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

               <p>You talke indeed, Section the ninth, of ſuch a miſtake of your words, but prove it not. Now to prevent all miſtakes, I ſhall come up unto your limitation: Cuſtome is not the onely rule of all decency in the Ceremonies of Gods ſervice, wherein God and Nature have preſcribed nothing particularly: <hi>Verbi gratiâ,</hi> in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:137084:39"/>the Surplice and Croſſe: For your Principles I ſuppoſe will lead you to aſſert the decency of the firſt uſage of the Croſſe in Baptiſme, and of the Surplice in Preaching and Praying; and indeed if the firſt uſage of theſe Ceremonies was undecent, it was ſinfull: and beſides, this decency was not a natural decency, dictated by the Law of Nature, as you your ſelf will confeſſe; but now if there were a decency in the firſt uſage of theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Cuſtome was not, could not be rule thereof, becauſe, as I declared out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the frequent uſage of a thing is required unto Cuſtome.</p>
               <p>For concluſion of this firſt part of mine exception, I ſhall intreat the Reader to take notice of the definition of Cuſtome, uſually quoted out of <hi>Iſiodore: Conſuetudo eſt jus quoddam moribus inſtitutum quod pro lege ſuſcipitur cum lex deficit.</hi> By this definition, Cuſtome hath not the force of a Law, but where the Law is defective, and the Word, the Law of God is not defective in <hi>appointing religious mystical Ceremonies,</hi> for 'tis ſo ſufficiently profitable <hi>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> as that the man of God may thereby be perfected, <hi>throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.

               <p n="2">2. There is a difference betwixt inſtitution and commandment or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ceremonies, for though every inſtitution be a commandment or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, yet every commandment or appointment is not an inſtitution, and hence a Church in a place may command and appoint the uniforme obſervance of Ceremonies inſtituted unto its hand by the Church in a former age.</p>
               <p>This pre ſuppoſed, I demand, whether you hold it here neceſſarily ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle, that all the Churche of God in ſucceeding Ages, ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>inſtitute</hi> Ceremonies in Gods worſhip, or elſe <hi>appoint and command</hi> ſuch as have been already inſtituted? If you thinke them all free, and diſobliged from both inſtitution and appointment of Ceremonies in worſhip, why then all Churches might lawfully have abſtained from ſuch both inſtitution and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and if ſuch abſtinence were lawfull, I may, I beleeve, preſume that it will be a very hard matter to prove ſuch an abſtinence to be inexpedient and againſt edification.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould ſay, that ſome, though not all, the Churches of God are obliged either to <hi>inſtitute</hi> Ceremonies in Gods worſhip, or to <hi>appoint and command</hi> ſuch as are already inſtituted, by precedent Churches ſucceeding the Apoſtles time, why then we ſhall juſtly expect that you ſhould ſpecifie or nominate ſuch Churches, and give ſome reaſon for the appropriation of ſuch an obligation unto ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, rather than unto others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your view of the Directory, page 19. you affirm that in the command of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> there is a proof of the more than <hi>lawfulneſſe of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the preſcription of Ceremonies in a Church is more than lawfull, and hereupon I imagined that you affirmed it to be neceſſary; but it ſeems I was miſtaken in your meaning: I ſhall therefore wait for a further explication of it, and therein I ſhall deſire to know what you underſtand by the <hi>more than lawfulneſs of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the beginning of the 52 Sect. you perplex the ſtate of the Queſtion, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing in the circumſtances of Gods worſhip, which are by the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts expreſly excluded from the Queſtion, for they limit it onely unto humane religious Ceremonies. Now betwixt theſe and the circumſtances of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, there is a great, and very wide difference.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Circumſtances of time, place, order, and decency, &amp;c. <hi>are neceſsary, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in generall;</hi> but humane religious Ceremonies are not <hi>neceſſary in generall,</hi> as will ſoon appear when you goe about to prove ſuch a neceſſity of them. It is impoſſible for Gods worſhip to be performed without ſome circumſtances, but it is very poſſible for Gods worſhip to bee celebrated without any humane reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Circumſtances of Gods worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> a fitting time and place, a decent Pew and Pulpit, a fair and handſome cloath for the Communion Table, are not Worſhip; but humane religious Ceremonies are in their nature Worſhip, as being inſtituted to lift up Gods honour immediately in their uſe and end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Things of meer order require no ordering: Time and place require not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time and place to circumſtance them aright; but now humane ſacred Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are capable of time and place, and of being ordered.</p>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:137084:43"/>
               <p>Your firſt inſtance is in the geſture, in which publick prayer is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt.</p>
               <p>But this inſtance is very impertinent: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is in the general neceſſary, ſo that it is utterly impoſſible for Prayer to be put up, but in ſome geſture or other; but the Ceremonies which Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts oppoſe, are meere humane inventions, and ſo unneceſſary in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have, for the particular geſture in Prayer, ſufficient warrant and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the light of Nature and Scripture, without any humane inſtitution: But we have no direction in Scripture for particular humane Ceremonies: This is very well ſet down in <hi>Ames</hi> diſp. about Ceremon. pag. 139. pag. 151. <hi>No ſuch thing can with any colour be averred of Surplice, Croſſe and the like.</hi> I doe not quote <hi>Ames,</hi> as if I thought you any thing valued what he ſaid, but that the Reader might know the true ſtate of the queſtion, and that in the laying of it down you have not ſo much as conſulted your adverſaries.</p>
               <p>But now to prevent as much as may bee the multiplying of needleſſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies betwixt us, I ſhall acknowledge that a Church may enjoyne the uſage of any reverent, lowly, ſubmiſſive geſture in publique ſupplications, when there is conveniencie for the uſage thereof.</p>
               <p>But yet it will not hereupon follow, that all things are to be done in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of publique Prayer according unto the Churches appointment; for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church ſhould prohibit in publique Prayers the geſtures of kneeling, lifting up the eyes and the hands to heaven, I ſhould conclude ſuch an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Church whatſoever to be unlawfull, becauſe contrary unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe direction of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond inſtance is impertinent too, for the geſtures of Lauds, Hymnes and Confeſſions of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a matter of meer decency, and how remote matters of meere decency are from the Ceremonies in queſtion, I have declared a little before, I ſhall therefore now onely adde theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a rational man may by meer light of Nature, without any inſtitution, eaſily gather, what geſture is fitting, decent and agreeable unto theſe actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That notwithſtanding this, the Governours or Officers of a Church may appoint in theſe actions any decent geſture or poſture of the body, provided that by ſpeciall inſtitution they doe not put upon it any myſticall ſignification, and thereby make it a Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That from this grant it can never be inferred, that in thoſe geſtures which are to bee uſed in Lauds, Hymns, Confeſſions of the Faith, all things are to bee done according to the appointment of Church Governours: and my reaſon is, becauſe it is poſſible, that Church Governours may bee ſo irrational, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point here undecent geſtures, as that the people ſhould lye along on their faces in ſinging of Pſalmes of Praiſe, and in Confeſſion of the Faith. Now an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent geſture would be finfull, becauſe againſt the Apoſtles preſcription, <hi>Let all things be done decently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt place proceed we unto thoſe arguments, if I may ſo call them, which you have for confirmation of the propoſition, which I ſay is incumbent on you to prove: If you have for this any arguments in this your diſcourſe, they are, as I conceive, theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe obedience muſt be paid to thoſe Superiours, which watch over our ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:137084:43"/>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Apoſtle left order to <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>ſet in order the things that were wanting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe we are commanded to obey our Eccleſiaſtical as well as naturall and civil parents: Now let the Reader apply unto each of theſe arguments the propoſition that is to be proved, therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. is taken in ſuch a latitude, as that it includes the appointments of all the Churches of God in ſucceeding ages, and the conſequence will bee of an imperceptible va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity.</p>
               <p>The Reader may farther, if hee pleaſe, make another experiment touching theſe arguments, hee may try what they will conduce unto the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the words of <hi>Paul</hi> are a proof of the more than lawfulneſſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſuch Ceremonies as ours in a Church; if by the help of them he can come nigh this concluſion of the Doctors, I will confeſſe that I have been groſly miſtaken.</p>
               <p>And this might ſuffice for anſwer unto theſe three arguments; but yet I ſhall for the further ſatisfaction of the Reader ſay ſomething unto each of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, becauſe obedience muſt be paid to thoſe Superiours which watch over our ſouls; the place is <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. but this place will prove nothing for the humane inſtitution of religious Ceremonies, becauſe our Guides may rule over us without inſtitution of ſuch Ceremonies, and conſequently wee may pay obedience to them without practiſe of ſuch Ceremonies: The place is urged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for the Popes Coactive power to make Laws binding the conſcience, and in <hi>Whitakers</hi> Anſwer thereunto, Tom. 2. page. 722. you may take notice of this paſſage; <hi>Non conſtituit haee Jententia regnum Epiſcopis extra, aut ſupra Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium: non debent Epiſcopi ſuas traditiones aut leges, aut contra, aut extra, aut praeter Evangelium obtrudere. Obediendum ergo eſt, ſed cum cautione, ſi praeeant illi in Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, &amp; nil ſuum tradunt: nam ſi hoc fecerit omittendi ſunt, juxta illud, etiamſi nos, aut Angelus e Coelo, evangelizet vobis praeter id quod vobis evangelizavimus, anathemae eſto.</hi> Gal. 1.8. Let the Reader conſider whether our Ceremonies were not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>praeter Evangelium,</hi> beſides the Goſpel:</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument which you proſecute, Sect. 53, 54. is becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> left or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Titus, to ſet in order the things that were wanting;</hi> ſuch as the Apoſtle had left undiſpoſed of, in which they have made no rules, and the ſame power you think is left, by parity of reaſon, to the Biſhops in every Iſland:</p>
               <p>For anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the things that were wanting were wanting in <hi>Crete,</hi> left undone, as it is in the Margin of our Engliſh Bible, and not in the commiſſion or rules which <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Titus:</hi> for that <hi>Titus</hi> was to keep unto the inſtructions that he had received from <hi>Paul,</hi> you might have ſeen, if you had had the patience to have read unto the end of the verſe; for there the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle points to him the rule he ſhould walk by, hee was to ſet in order the things that were wanting in <hi>Crete,</hi> not of his own head, but accordîng to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paul; as I had appointed thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might farther alledge, that Biſhops (by whom you mean our Prelates) have not the ſame power delegated unto them, which <hi>Paul</hi> committed unto <hi>Titus:</hi> But I ſhall for the preſent wave this, becauſe it may occaſion a long digreſſion, and the former anſwer is abundantly ſatisfactory, and from it we may conclude; that ſuppoſe Biſhops had power left them to ſet in order things that are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet we may not thence collect, that they have power for inſtitution of new
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:137084:44"/>doctrinal Ceremonies, beſides thoſe inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, becauſe however there may be many things wanting in their Churches, which may need reformation, yet there is nothing wanting in the Scriptures, which needs to be ſupplied by humane additions.</p>
               <p>Your third Argument is drawn from the power of our Eccleſiaſtical parents and the obedience we owe unto them. <hi>It cannot be doubted, ſay you, either whether our Eccleſiaſtical parents have power to inſtitute in things omitted, and thereby remitted to their care by the Apoſtles, or whether we their obedient Children, that are commanded to act <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> according to appointment, ſhould from time to time, be diſobliged and free to diſobey them in whatſoever they appoint us?</hi> Here we have no argument, but only a begging of the thing in queſtion: It is not denied but that Eccleſiaſtical parents have power to appoint and diſpoſe of ſuch Circumſtances of time, place, order, decency <hi>&amp;c. as in their kind are neceſſary,</hi> but in particular <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation do vary:</hi> But that they have any power to inſtitute new Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, of myſtical ſignification, is a thing which you cannot but know to be conſtantly denied by your Antagoniſts, and therefore why you ſhould preſume the contrary evident, and never attempt the proof of it, I cannot ſufficiently wonder.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you have an argument couched in theſe words, <hi>it cannot be dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whether our Eccleſioſtical parents have power to inſtitute in things omitted, and thereby remitted to their care by the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But pray, Sir, do you in earneſt think, that if things be omitted by the Apoſtles, they are by them hereby remitted unto the care of Eccleſiaſtical parents in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages? Every one will confeſſe that it ſounds like a very ſtrange propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: however, you cannot expect that I ſhould ſwallow it, until you bring ſome confirmation of it.</p>
               <p>By this the Reader is, I hope, ſatisfied, that though your reading of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according unto appointment, were to take place, yet you have brought nothing to prove that, which you were juſtly called upon for proof of, <hi>viz.</hi> that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was to be taken here in this place of the Apoſtle in ſuch a latitude, as to comprehend humane, as well as divine appointment.</p>
               <p>But though you faile in your proofes, your adverſaries the non-conformiſts are before hand with you, for they have proved that mens inſtitution of religious Ceremonies omitted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles is a moſt plaine detraction and palpable derogation, from

               <p>I foreſee that it will be alledged, that all theſe arguments are long ago anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and unto this I ſhall at preſent onely give this ſhort Reply, that they have been vindicated from all anſwers, as by others, ſo eſpecially by <hi>Ames,</hi> and that this vindication of them remains unto this day unanſwered.</p>
               <p>However, I ſhall ſtay a while upon two places in Deuteronomy, which the Non-conformiſts uſually urge againſt our Ceremonies, and examine an anſwer which the conformiſts gives thereunto, becauſe this examination will conduce very much unto the learning of the truth in the controverſy of Ceremonies: the places are <hi>Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture is a rule of even Ceremonies in Gods worſhip, for it gives preſcriptions and directions in the new Teſtament concerning the Sacraments of Baptiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>A third reply is, that the members of this diſtinction are not oppoſite, as the members of every good diſtinction ſhould be, for Ceremonies of worſhip though th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Worſhip is divided into moral and Ceremonial, ſo that Ceremonial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a ſubjective part of worſhip, a ſort and kind of worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moſaical Ceremonies under the Law were, and the Sacraments under the Goſpel are parts of worſhip: the diſtinction then betwixt the parts, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ceremonies of worſhip, is an artleſs and falſe diſtinction. To make this yet more evident, I ſhall propound ſome arguments, by which the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts prove our Ceremonies to be external worſhip, for then it will follow, that they are parts of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe external Ceremonies whoſe proper uſe is the honouring of God, are external worſhip: But our Ceremonies are ſuch, and therefore they are external worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All external Ceremonies in their nature, formally elicited from religion, are external worſhip: But our Ceremonies are ſuch, and therefore they are external worſhip.</p>

               <p>Therefore they are parts of divine worſhip.</p>

               <p n="56">56. <hi>This will detaine me no longer, then whilſt I mind the Reader, that in a diſcourſe of the benefits which we receive from Chriſt in the Saerament, &amp; otherwiſe,</hi> M. Hooker <hi>undertakes to ſet downe how Chriſt in his humane nature is communicated to us, and ſo preſent with us; To this end three things he ſhewes at large.</hi> 1. <hi>That as nothing created can be unlimited, or receive any ſuch accident from any as may really make it infinite, ſo neither the ſoul nor body of Chriſt, nor Chriſt as man, nor according to his humane nature, can poſſibly be every where preſent, no nor the ſubstance of the body of Chriſt, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath or can have any preſence but onely local.</hi> 2. <hi>That this cannot be rendred poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either by the grace of union with the Diety, nor by any other poſſible meanes, as he at large excellently deduceth it,</hi> pag. 300, 301, 302, 3. <hi>That it may peradventure be well enough granted in ſome ſenſe, and after a ſort, that Chriſt is every where preſent, as man,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>In reſpect of the conjunction of the humane nature with the Deity, which conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is extended as farre as the Deity, the actual poſition being reſtrained, and tied to a certain place, and</hi> 2. <hi>By cooperation with the Deity, and that in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="57">57. <hi>Now on this third head, (without reflecting on the two former, which aſſure us of the authors meaning in it) two paſſages</hi> M. J. <hi>takes hold of, which if he know any thing in either Philoſophy, or ſcholaſtical divinity, are both guilty of a groſſe miſtake, and cannot be ſufficiently wondred at by him, that they ſhould fall from ſo a learned a pen.</hi>

Indeed Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſayes, that it may well enough be granted <hi>in ſome ſenſe, and after a ſort,</hi> that Chriſt is every where preſent as man, <hi>viz.</hi> in two reſpects; but whether this were lyable to exception, I meddle not, 'tis the firſt of the reſpects which he mentioneth, that I queſtion, and the words that I challenge, the Reader may find page 141, of my Treat. of the Fulneſſe of Chriſt thus ſummed up. Then for the great <hi>Hooker,</hi> whereas he ſaith, <hi>That the conjunction of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with Deity, is extended as farre as Deity, that the Body of Chriſt is joyned unto Deity, whereſoever Deity is, that his Bodily ſubſtance hath every where a preſence of true conjunction with Deity This alſo is eaſily refuted, &amp;c.</hi> Now this he affirmeth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and ſimply without any limitation, and not in a ſort, or in ſome ſenſe, and in two reſpects; and this any man that hath his eyes in his head may ſee, that will compare Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and me together; and if any learned and impartial Reader will but make this compariſon, I ſhall be very well contented that hee ſhall judge betwixt us, who of us hath moſt treſpaſſed againſt practical Divinity, I in my charge of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> or the learned Doctor in his groſſe and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble falſification of my ſaid charge? But I ſhall in charity hope, that this falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was but a miſtake, proceeding from his haſty and over paſſionate zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the memory of Mr. <hi>Hooker:</hi> Whereas he is pleaſed to talk his pleaſure of my pawning all my Philoſophy and ſcholaſtical Divinity, I ſhall only humbly aſſume the boldneſſe to intimate thus much unto the Reader, that though I have no great ſtore of either, yet I hope I have enough to attend (that I may borrow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors phraſe) the motions of him, and all other admirers of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the matter queſtioned: but if he ſhall decline all future further debate of it, I ſhall with a great deal of probability conclude, that what Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith is uncapable of any tolerable vindication: for if he were defenſible, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is ſo able as that he could, and withall ſo zealous a lover and admirer of him, as that he would continue the juſtification of him: Now from the undefenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in this one point, I ſhall onely take occaſion to admoniſh his followers, that ſeeing he hath erred in ſo weighty a point, therefore he might erre in matters of a farre inferiour nature, eſpecially ſeeing the times were ſuch, as that they tranſported with prejudice many men, that were unqueſtionably o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe very learned and godly.</p>

            <head>Some Advertiſements to the Reader.</head>
            <p>I Shall in a word acquaint thee with the relation &amp; pertinency of theſe two foregoing Debates unto the reſt of the Book. The Letters have an apt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Tract of <hi>Original Righteouſneſſe.</hi> And the Reply unto Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> may be referred unto the Treatile concerning the <hi>indifferency of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions;</hi> and indeed it was the Doctors unjuſt charge of me, and <hi>Ames,</hi> with the denyal of things Indifferent, that occaſioned that Treatiſe. Theſe two pieces have layne a long time by me (as can be atteſted by divers Gentlemen, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, unto whom they have long ſince been communicated) But I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Book-ſeller to deferre the publication of them, until a Second Part of the Mixture of Scholaſtical and Practical Divinity was ready: And that had been long ſince extant, if Sickneſſe, with other private croſſes, together with the publique troubles and diſtractions of the times, had not hindred: He hath alſo prevailed with me, to reſerve for a Third Part, all my future Replyes, unto all ſuch as have, or ſhall write againſt me. Onely I ſhall in part alter this reſolution touching the Nameleſſe Author of the Defence of Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not that I think it meritorious of any ſerious conſideration; for 'tis fraught, all along, with ſuch reviling, boaſting, and inſulting language, as is every way unſuitable unto the gravity of a Divine, the ingenuity of a Scholar, the charity, meekneſſe, and humility of a Chriſtian; nay the morality of a man. An ingenuous and good natur'd Pagan, would highly ſcorne to treat an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with ſuch incivilities, as he doth me. But becauſe ſome, who are of the ſame perſwaſion with the Author in other particulars, have triumphed, and inſulted in this his doughty work, as unanſwerable; I ſhall therefore, as ſoon as that which is now under my hands (viz. An Expoſition upon the 7th. of the <hi>Romans</hi>) is finiſhed, addreſſe my ſelf unto the examination thereof. I am ſo charitable as to think, that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath ſo much of Chriſtianity, ſo much of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of a Scholar, of a Gentleman in him, as not to accept, or approve of this <hi>Thraſonical</hi> and <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> Second. And if the Doctor diſowne him, I might paſſe him by with ſilence, and a juſt neglect. But if the Doctor ſhall judge, that 'tis but juſtice, to chaſtiſe with ſcoffs, calumnies, and reproaches, ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a perſon, as my ſelf, for daring to diſſent from him, and to repreſent the reaſons of my ſaid diſſent, though in a calme and modeſt way: I ſhall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto all the world, how unagreeable this is unto that humility and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, for which the Doctor is generally famed. To irritate the Doctor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, this Libeller tels him, that I have publiquely bragged, that I have made him a Dunce. But I profeſſe, that this is a groſſe, and moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy untruth; and he can bring no witneſſes for it, but Knights of the Poſt. With the like falſhood, diſingenuity, and malice, he pretends, page 96. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I contumeliouſly undervalue the Doctors Critical Learning, and make him to be but a petty Grammaticaſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hereupon he ſpends near five pages, in an Apology for Criticks in general, and the Doctor in particular. And what I pray is the ground of this terrible accuſation? Why (forſooth) I ſaid, I <hi>am very loath to enter into a conteſt with ſo great a Critick, about the meaning of a word.</hi> Hereupon he inferres, that I make the Doctor to be but a whifling Grammarian; that I account a Critick but a Grammarian, and a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ian, but an empty Paedagogue: But that for theſe odious inferences there
<pb facs="tcp:137084:47"/>is no colour, or ſhadow in my words, will be quickly diſcern'd by every Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But ſuch looſe ſequels as theſe, are very rife, and thick in his Book. And of this, I doe not doubt, but I ſhall ſhortly, make ſo perfect a diſcovery, as ſhall give full ſatisfaction, touching the vaſt abilities of this our Mr. <hi>Thraſo,</hi> unto all impartial Readers, ſave ſuch whoſe underſtandings reach no further than Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and Playes. His numerous Quotations out of the School-men, have induced ſome to admire him for his deep inſight into Scholaſtical Divinity. But let ſuch his Admirers confider, whether hee be likely to be ſuch a profound School-man, as they ſuppoſe him, who talkes of the Author of <hi>Collegium Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plutenſe,</hi> as of a ſingle perſon, pag. 30. and queſtions whether <hi>Capreolus</hi> quote <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> only to refute him, as the latter School-men doe the former, pag. 341. whereas <hi>Capreolus</hi> was the profeſſed Champion of <hi>Aquinas:</hi> And his Book on the Sentences conſiſteth chiefly of collections out of <hi>Aquinas;</hi> and hereupon he is termed, <hi>Thomiſtarum princeps.</hi> Notwithſtanding then this Gentleman makes ſuch frequent Muſters of the Names of the School-men, as if he were <hi>Nomenclator</hi> to them, it is unto me very probable, that this is his firſt conſiderable voyage that he ever made into them; and that now too he hath travelled in them but by the Index. Three great advantages this our Libeller hath againſt me: Firſt, his <hi>Billingſ-gate</hi> Rhetorick, by which, 'tis not improbable, he hoped to tempt me into ſuch an outrageous fury, as his zeal for Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> hath tranſported him with. But unto this I ſhal return nothing, but my pitty and prayers, that God would pardon, and heal this his diſtemper. The ſecond is, the concealment of his Name, for by this he hazards no credit; his pretence for it is, that I might not run into perſonal declamation. How lyable he is to perſonal defamation, I know not: But let him be never ſo obnoxious, he may be ſecure, and need not fear any ſuch uſage from me: For 'tis that which I ſhall ſtudiouſly decline in all conteſts whatſoever, though my Antagoniſt ſhould be a Papiſt, a Turk, a Pelagian, or a Socinian; for I know that perſonal invectives will betray the beſt cauſe unto jealouſies and ſuſpicions. And beſides, a man cannot throw dirt and dung in anothers mans face, but ſome of it will ſtick to his own fingers. A third artifice that he hath, is the ſwelling of his Book into ſo large a volume, as that may either wholly prevent, or much delay all Replication. My Refutation was printed about three years ſince in 40. pages, and his Defence is now come forth in 644. pages. Unto this tediouſneſſe I ſhall apply what Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſpeaks of his Popiſh Opponent; <hi>Should</hi> I <hi>follow him in this proportion, He might expect an Anſwer in</hi> Toſtatus hides, <hi>whoſe first words ſhould be,</hi> Quis legit haec? <hi>Or if my patience would delay my Reply to the juſt paces of his Anſwer, this Volume of his would perhaps be vaniſhed into Grocers ſhops, for waſte paper,</hi> in thuris piperiſe cucullos, <hi>and would no more need anſwer, than now it deſerveth one.</hi> Againſt this his volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe I ſhall make uſe of this expedient; I ſhall conſult ſome learned and judicious friends, and deſire them faithfully and impartially to ſelect ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as they think material, and them onely I ſhall examine. But I ſhall detaine thee, Reader, no longer. All that I have to deſire further of thee, is thy patience, that thou wilt ſuſpend a while thy cenſure, untill thou canſt hear what I can ſay for my ſelfe.</p>

               </gap>, he referreth, for limitation, unto what hee had ſaid concerning the intenſion and remiſſion of privation, <hi>n.</hi> 43, 44, 45. There he layeth down this Canon, <hi>privatio non ſuſcipit magis &amp; minus.</hi> Privations have no degrees, are not intended nor remitted. But this he tels us is to be underſtood of not partial privations, ſuch as thoſe now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc'd in: for ſuch are privations onely <hi>ſecundum quid;</hi> but of total privations, ſuch as blindneſſe, dumbneſſe, deafneſſe, death. Theſe are uncapable of degrees, and ſo likewiſe there can be no mixture, or coheſion of them.

This adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement I thought fit to inſert, for the prevention of unneceſſary cavils: But yet I muſt confeſſe, that <hi>medium participationis</hi> was put into the rule <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and contributes nothing to the matter in hand: So that the Reader, if hee pleaſe may leave it out; for the ſtreſſe of the proof lyes only upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> that betwixt things privatively oppoſite, theres no <hi>medium</hi> of abnegation in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubjects.
